### Creating a pull request description

There are two parts to a pull request description: Summary and Testing.

#### Summary

Use this as a space to provide details about your new feature. Your summary should primarily focus on what has changed, and why it has changed.

#### Testing

For each pull request, you are expected to test the defaults to make sure no regressions were introduced as part of your change. When adding new features, you are expected to add new test cases that cover the new functionality.
