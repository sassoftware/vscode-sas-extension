Welcome to the SAS Extension for Visual Studio Code! The SAS extension is lightweight, runs anywhere, and allows you to integrate SAS with other languages. You can connect directly to SAS Viya and SAS 9 and run code.

Before you can run SAS code, you must [configure the SAS extension](https://sassoftware.github.io/vscode-sas-extension/Configurations/) to access your SAS 9.4 (remote or local) server or a SAS Viya server and [add a connection profile](https://sassoftware.github.io/vscode-sas-extension/Configurations/Profiles/).

The SAS extension includes many [features](https://sassoftware.github.io/vscode-sas-extension/Features/) to help you access your data, write and run code, and create SAS notebooks.

- SAS syntax highlighting and help, code completion, and code snippets
- Navigate SAS Content and libraries, including table viewer
- Create notebooks for SAS, SQL, Python and other languages
