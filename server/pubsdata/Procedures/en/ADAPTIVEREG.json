{"name":"ADAPTIVEREG","statements":[{"name":"PROC ADAPTIVEREG","description":"[SAS/STAT 12.1 Experimental Procedure] † The ADAPTIVEREG procedure fits multivariate adaptive regression splines as defined by Friedman (1991b). The method is a nonparametric regression technique that combines both regression splines and model selection methods. It does not assume parametric model forms and does not require specification of knot values for constructing regression spline terms. Instead, it constructs spline basis functions in an adaptive way by automatically selecting appropriate knot values for different variables and obtains reduced models by applying model selection techniques. † The main features of the ADAPTIVEREG procedure are as follows: † • supports classification variables with ordering options • enables you to force effects in the final model or restrict variables in linear forms • supports options for fast forward selection • supports data with response variables that are distributed in the exponential family • supports partitioning of data into training, validation, and testing roles • provides leave-one-out and k-fold cross validation • produces a graphical representation of the selection process, model fit, functional components, and fit diagnostics • produces an output data set that contains predicted values and residuals • produces an output data set that contains the design matrix of formed basis functions • supports multiple SCORE statements","help":"PROC ADAPTIVEREG <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DETAILS<=(detail-options)>> <NAMELEN=number> <NLOPTIONS(options)> <NOTHREADS> <OUTDESIGN<(options)>=SAS-data-set> <PLOTS=ALL | COMPONENTS | DIAGNOSTICS... > <SEED=number> <SINGULAR=number | EPSILON=number> <TESTDATA=SAS-data-set> <THREADS=n> <VALDATA=SAS-data-set>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <ORDER=<DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ>... > ; \n   \n\tFREQ variable ;     \n\tMODEL <ADDITIVE> <ALPHA=number> <CVMETHOD=<RANDOM(n) | INDEX(variable)>> ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT <COOKD=> <COVRATIO=> <OUT=SAS-data-set> ...; \n   \n\tPARTITION <FRACTION(<fraction> <VALIDATE=fraction>)> <ROLEVAR=variable (<TEST='value'> <TRAIN='value'> <VALIDATE='value'>)> ; \n   \n\tSCORE <DATA=SAS data set> <OUT=SAS data set> <PREDICTED <=name>> ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT variable ; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the SAS data set to be read by PROC ADAPTIVEREG.

You can specify the following options: ABSCONV=r | ABSTOL=r specifies an absolute function convergence criterion by which minimization stops. The default value of r is the negative square root of the largest double-precision value, which serves only as a protection against overflows. ABSFCONV=r | ABSFTOL=r specifies an absolute function difference convergence criterion. The default value is r=0. ABSGCONV=r | ABSGTOL=r specifies an absolute gradient convergence criterion. This criterion is not used by the NMSIMP technique. The default value is r = 1E–5. FCONV=r | FTOL=r specifies a relative function convergence criterion. GCONV=r | GTOL=r specifies a relative gradient convergence criterion. This criterion is not used by the NMSIMP technique. The default value is r = 1E–8. HESSIAN=hessian-options specifies the Hessian matrix type used in the optimization of likelihood functions, if the Newton-Raphson technique is used. You can specify the following hessian-options: EXPECTED -- requests that the Hessian matrix in optimization be computed as the negative of the expected information matrix. OBSERVED -- requests that the Hessian matrix in optimization be computed as the negative of the observed information matrix. For many specified distribution families and link functions, the observed information matrix is equal to the expected information matrix. The default is HESSIAN=EXPECTED. MAXFUNC=n | MAXFU=n specifies the maximum number of function calls in the optimization process. The default values are as follows, depending on the optimization technique: • TRUREG, NRRIDG, and NEWRAP: 125 • QUANEW and DBLDOG: 500 • CONGRA: 1000 • NMSIMP: 3000 The optimization can terminate only after completing a full iteration. Therefore, the number of function calls that are actually performed can exceed the number that is specified by this option. You can select the optimization technique by specifying the TECHNIQUE= option. MAXITER=n | MAXIT=n specifies the maximum number of iterations in the optimization process. The default values are as follows, depending on the optimization technique: • TRUREG, NRRIDG, and NEWRAP: 50 • QUANEW and DBLDOG: 200 • CONGRA: 400 • NMSIMP: 1000 These default values also apply when n is specified as a missing value. You can select the optimization technique by specifying the TECHNIQUE= option. MAXTIME=r specifies an upper limit of r seconds of CPU time for the optimization process. The default value is the largest floating-point double representation of your computer. The time that is specified by the MAXTIME= option is checked only once at the end of each iteration. Therefore, the actual running time can be longer than the time specified by this option. MINITER=n | MINIT=n specifies the minimum number of iterations. The default value is 0. If you request more iterations than are actually needed for convergence to a stationary point, the optimization algorithms can behave strangely. For example, the effect of rounding errors can prevent the algorithm from continuing for the required number of iterations. TECHNIQUE=keyword specifies the optimization technique to obtain maximum likelihood estimates for nonnormal distributions. You can choose from the following techniques by specifying the appropriate keyword: CONGRA -- performs a conjugate-gradient optimization. DBLDOG -- performs a version of double-dogleg optimization. NEWRAP -- performs a Newton-Raphson optimization that combines a line-search algorithm with ridging. NMSIMP -- performs a Nelder-Mead simplex optimization. NONE -- performs no optimization.

If you omit the explanatory effects, the procedure fits an intercept-only model. You must specify exactly one MODEL statement. You can specify two forms of the MODEL statement. The first form, referred to as single-trial syntax, is applicable to binary, ordinal, and nominal response data. The second form, referred to as events/trials syntax, is restricted to binary response data. You use the single-trial syntax when each observation in the DATA= data set contains information about only a single trial, such as a single subject in an experiment. When each observation contains information about multiple binary response trials, such as the counts of the number of observed subjects and the number of subjects who respond, then you can use the events/trials syntax. In the events/trials syntax, you specify two variables that contain count data for a binomial experiment. These two variables are separated by a slash. The value of the first variable, events, is the number of positive responses (or events). The value of the second variable, trials, is the number of trials. The values of both events and (trials–events) must be nonnegative and the value of trials must be positive for the response to be valid. In the single-trial syntax, you specify one variable (on the left side of the equal sign) as the response variable. This variable can be character or numeric. You can specify variable options specific to the response variable immediately after the response variable with parentheses around them. For both forms of the MODEL statement, explanatory effects follow the equal sign. Variables can be either continuous or classification variables.
