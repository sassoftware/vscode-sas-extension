{"name":"ANOVA","statements":[{"name":"PROC ANOVA","description":"The ANOVA procedure performs analysis of variance (ANOVA) for balanced data from a wide variety of experimental designs. In analysis of variance, a continuous response variable, known as a dependent variable, is measured under experimental conditions identified by classification variables, known as independent variables. The variation in the response is assumed to be due to effects in the classification, with random error accounting for the remaining variation. † The ANOVA procedure is one of several procedures available in SAS/STAT software for analysis of variance. The ANOVA procedure is designed to handle balanced data (that is, data with equal numbers of observations for every combination of the classification factors), whereas the GLM procedure can analyze both balanced and unbalanced data. Because PROC ANOVA takes into account the special structure of a balanced design, it is faster and uses less storage than PROC GLM for balanced data. † Use PROC ANOVA for the analysis of balanced data only, with the following exceptions: one-way analysis of variance, Latin square designs, certain partially balanced incomplete block designs, completely nested (hierarchical) designs, and designs with cell frequencies that are proportional to each other and are also proportional to the background population. These exceptions have designs in which the factors are all orthogonal to each other.","help":"PROC ANOVA <DATA=SAS-data-set> <MANOVA> <MULTIPASS> <NAMELEN=n> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <PLOTS=NONE>;     \n\tABSORB variables ;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS <TRUNCATE> ; \n   \n\tFREQ variable;     \n\tMANOVA <E=effect> <H=<<effects> | INTERCEPT | _ALL_>> <M=equation,...,equation | (row-of-matrix,...,row-of-matrix)> ...; \n   \n\tMEANS <ALPHA=α> <BON> <CLM> ...; \n   \n\tMODEL <INTERCEPT> <NOUNI> ; \n   \n\tPERFORMANCE;     \n\tREPEATED <CONTRAST<(ordinal-reference-level)>> <HELMERT> <IDENTITY> ...; \n   \n\tTEST <E=effect> <H=effects> ; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the SAS data set used by the ANOVA procedure.","help":"DATA=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"MANOVA","optional":true,"description":"Requests the multivariate mode of eliminating observations with missing values.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"MULTIPASS","optional":true,"description":"Requests that PROC ANOVA reread the input data set, when necessary, instead of writing the values of dependent variables to a utility file.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"NAMELEN=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the length of effect names to be n characters long, where n is a value between 20 and 200 characters.
