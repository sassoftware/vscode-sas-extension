For a supervised learning model that has a nominal target, the ASSESS procedure produces lift information and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) information. For a regression model, the ASSESS procedure performs a quantile binning of the predictions and then returns the summary statistics of the response variable for each bin. PROC ASSESS also calculates fit statistics such as average square error, mean square logarithmic error, mean absolute error, mean consequential error, and multiclass log loss. † The expected input to the ASSESS procedure is score data from supervised learning models.","help":"PROC ASSESS DATA=CAS-libref.data-table <MAXITER=integer> <NBINS=integer> <NCUTS=integer> <NTHREADS=number>;     \n\tBY variable ;\n    \n\tFITSTAT <DELIMITER|DLM = “character”> <PEVENT=“event-list”> PVAR = variables ...;\n    \n\tFREQ variable ;\n    \n\tINPUT|VAR variable;\n    \n\tTARGET <EVENT=“string”> <LEVEL=<INTERVAL | NOMINAL>> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","description":"Names the input data table for PROC ASSESS to use.
