{"name":"ASTORE","statements":[{"name":"PROC ASTORE","description":"The ASTORE procedure is an interactive procedure in which each statement runs immediately. The ASTORE procedure describes, manages, and scores with an analytic store. The analytic store is the result of a SAVESTATE statement from another analytic procedure; it is a binary file that contains that procedureâ€™s state after it completes the training phase of data analysis. Some procedures that support a SAVESTATE statement are the FACTMAC, FOREST, and SVMACHINE procedures. You can use the analytic store at a later time for scoring.","help":"PROC ASTORE ;     \n\tDESCRIBE <EPCODE<=code-file-name>> RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table STORE=local-file-name ...;\n    \n\tDOWNLOAD RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table STORE=local-file-name ;\n    \n\tSCORE DATA=CAS-libref.data-table OUT=CAS-libref.data-table RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table ...;\n    \n\tSETOPTION name value;\n    \n\tUPLOAD RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table STORE=local-file-name ;\n"},{"name":"DESCRIBE","description":"The DESCRIBE statement specifies the name or identifier of an analytic store either in the local file system or in a data table stored in CAS.
