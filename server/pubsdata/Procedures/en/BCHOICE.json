{"name":"BCHOICE","statements":[{"name":"PROC BCHOICE","description":"The BCHOICE (Bayesian choice) procedure performs Bayesian analysis for discrete choice models. Discrete choice models are used in marketing research to model decision makers' choices among alternative products and services. The decision maker might be people, households, companies and so on, and the alternatives might be products, services, actions, or any other options or items about which choices must be made (Train 2009). The collection of alternatives that are available to the decision makers is called a choice set. † Discrete choice models are derived under the assumption of utility-maximizing behavior by decision makers. When individuals are asked to make one choice among a set of alternatives, they usually determine the level of utility that each alternative offers.","help":"PROC BCHOICE <ACCEPTTOL=n> <ALGORITHM=GAMERMAN | RWM | LATENT> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DIAGNOSTICS=NONE | <(keyword-list)>> <DIC> <HITPROBABILITY> <INF=value> <LOGPOST> <MAXTUNE=n> <MCHISTORY=BRIEF | DETAILED | NONE> <MINTUNE=n> <NBI=n> <NMC=n> <NOCLPRINT<=n>> <NTHREADS=n | NTHREAD=n> <NTU=n> <OUTPOST=SAS-data-set | OUT=SAS-data-set> <PLOTS=ALL | AUTOCORR | DENSITY... > <SCALE=value> <SEED=n> <STATISTICS=ALL | BRIEF | CORR... > <TARGACCEPT=value> <THIN=n | NTHIN=n> <TUNEWT=value>;     \n\tBY variables;\n    \n\tCLASS <CPREFIX=n> <DESCENDING> <LPREFIX=n> ...;\n    \n\tMODEL <ALTERIDX=variable> <CHOICESET=(variables)> <CHOICETYPE=<BINARY | MAXDIFF | ALLOCATION>> ...;\n    \n\tPREDDIST <COVARIATES=SAS-data-set> <NALTER=nNALTERNATIVE=n> <OUTPRED=SAS-data-set> ...;\n    \n\tRANDOM <COVPRIOR=<IWISHART>> <MONITORMONITOR=(numeric-list)MONITOR=RANDOM (number)> <NOOUTPOST> ...;\n    \n\tRESTRICT <'label'> fixed-effect operand operator <value> ;RESTRICT <'label'> fixed-effect constraint-list;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ACCEPTTOL=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies a tolerance for acceptance probabilities for the random walk sampler.
