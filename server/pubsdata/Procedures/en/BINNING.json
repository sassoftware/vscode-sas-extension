{"name":"BINNING","statements":[{"name":"PROC BINNING","description":"Binning is a common step in the data preparation stage of the model-building process. You can use binning to classify missing variables, reduce the impact of outliers, and generate multiple effects. The generated effects are useful and contain certain nonlinear information about the original interval variables. The BINNING procedure supports a few binning methods that are described in the following subsections. The BINNING procedure can also calculate the weight of evidence (WOE) and information value (IV) based on binning results.","help":"PROC BINNING <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <METHOD=BUCKET | QUANTILE | WINSOR(RATE=)... > <NTHREADS=number-of-threads> <NUMBIN=integer> <WOE(WOEADJUST=number)>;     \n\tCODE <FILE= filename> ;\n    \n\tFREQ variable ;\n    \n\tINPUT <NUMBIN=integer> ;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <COPYVAR=variable | COPYVARS=(variables)> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n    \n\tTARGET <EVENT=“category”> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC BINNING to use.
