You specify the proportions for testing and validation by using the TEST= and VALIDATE= suboptions. If you specify both the TEST= and VALIDATE= suboptions, then the sum of the specified fractions must be less than 1 and the remaining fraction of the observations are assigned to the training role. The SEED= option specifies an integer that is used to start the pseudorandom number generator for random partitioning of data for training, testing, and validation. If you do not specify SEED=number or if number is less than or equal to 0, the seed is generated by reading the time of day from the computer’s clock.","help":"FRACTION=VALIDATE= | TEST= | SEED=","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"VALIDATE=","type":"value"},{"name":"TEST=","type":"value"},{"name":"SEED=","type":"value"}]},{"name":"ROLE=","optional":true,"aliases":["ROLEVAR="],"description":"Names the variable in the input data table whose values are used to assign roles to each observation.
