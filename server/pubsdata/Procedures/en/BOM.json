{"name":"BOM","statements":[{"name":"PROC BOM","description":"The BOM procedure performs bill-of-material processing. It reads all product structure records from a product structure data file and all part \"master\" records from a part master file, and composes the combined information into indented bills of material. In addition, PROC BOM can also output a summarized parts list, which lists all items and their total quantities required (needed to be made or ordered) in order to fill a given production plan. A production plan is an agreed-upon plan that comes from the aggregate planning function; specifically, it is the overall level of manufacturing output planned to be produced for each product family in each planning period (Cox and Blackstone, J. H., Jr. 1998). Production plan information can be included in the part master file.","help":"PROC BOM <DATA=SAS-data-set><DUPLICATE=COMBINE | DISCARD | KEEP><NOUTIL><NPARTS=nparts><NRELATIONSHIPS=nrelts | NRELTS=nrelts><OUT=SAS-data-set | INDBOM=SAS-data-set><PMDATA=SAS-data-set | PMASTER=SAS-data-set><SUMMARYOUT=SAS-data-set | SUMPART=SAS-data-set>;     \n\tSTRUCTURE <COMPONENT=(variables)><ENDITEM=(enditems)><FACTOR=(variables) | SFACTOR=(variables)> ...;","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"aliases":["PSDATA="],"description":"Names the input SAS data set that contains all the product structure records (parent-component relationship, quantity per assembly, scrap factor, etc.) for a product, product line, plant or company.
