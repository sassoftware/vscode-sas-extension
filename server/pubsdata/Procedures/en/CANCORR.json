{"name":"CANCORR","statements":[{"name":"PROC CANCORR","description":"The CANCORR procedure performs canonical correlation, partial canonical correlation, and canonical redundancy analysis. † Canonical correlation is a generalization of multiple correlation for analyzing the relationship between two sets of variables. In multiple correlation, you examine the relationship between a linear combination of a set of explanatory variables, X, and a single response variable, Y. In canonical correlation, you examine the relationship between linear combinations of the set of X variables and linear combinations of a set of Y variables. These linear combinations are called canonical variables or canonical variates. Either set of variables can be considered explanatory or response variables, since the statistical model is symmetric in the two sets of variables. Simple and multiple correlation are special cases of canonical correlation in which one or both sets contain a single variable.","help":"PROC CANCORR <ALL> <B> <CLB> <CORRB> <CORR> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <EDF=error-df> <INT> <MSTAT=FAPPROX | EXACT> <NCAN=number> <NOINT> <NOPRINT> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <PARPREFIX=name> <PCORR> <PROBT> <RDF=regression-df> <REDUNDANCY> <SEB> <SHORT> <SIMPLE> <SINGULAR=p> <SMC> <SPCORR> <SQPCORR> <SQSPCORR> <STB> <T> <VDEP> <VNAME=label> <VPREFIX=name> <WDEP> <WNAME=label> <WPREFIX=name>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tFREQ variable;\n    \n\tPARTIAL variables ;\n    \n\tVAR;\n    \n\tWEIGHT variable;\n    \n\tWITH variables ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ALL","optional":true,"description":"Displays simple statistics, correlations among the input variables, the confidence limits for the regression coefficients, and the canonical redundancy analysis.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"B","optional":true,"description":"Produces raw regression coefficients from the regression analyses.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"CLB","optional":true,"description":"Produces the 95% confidence limits for the regression coefficients from the regression analyses.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"CORRB","optional":true,"description":"Produces correlations among the regression coefficient estimates.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"CORR","optional":true,"description":"Produces correlations among the original variables.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the SAS data set to be analyzed by PROC CANCORR.","help":"DATA=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"EDF=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the error degrees of freedom if the input observations are residuals from a regression analysis.","help":"EDF=*error-df*","type":"value"},{"name":"INT","optional":true,"description":"Requests that statistics for the intercept be included when B, CLB, SEB, T, or PROBT is specified for the regression analyses.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"MSTAT=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the method of evaluating the multivariate test statistics.","help":"MSTAT=FAPPROX | EXACT","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"FAPPROX","description":"Specifies that the multivariate tests are evaluated using the usual approximations based on the F distribution.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"EXACT","description":"Computes exact p-values for three of the four tests (Wilks’ lambda, the Hotelling-Lawley trace, and Roy’s greatest root) and an improved F approximation for the fourth (Pillai’s trace).","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"NCAN=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the number of canonical variables for which full output is desired.","help":"NCAN=*number*","type":"value"},{"name":"NOINT","optional":true,"description":"Omits the intercept from the canonical correlation and regression models.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"NOPRINT","optional":true,"description":"Suppresses the display of all output.
