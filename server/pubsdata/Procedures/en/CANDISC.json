{"name":"CANDISC","statements":[{"name":"PROC CANDISC","description":"Canonical discriminant analysis is a dimension-reduction technique related to principal component analysis and canonical correlation. The methodology used in deriving the canonical coefficients parallels that of a one-way MANOVA. MANOVA tests for equality of the mean vector across class levels. Canonical discriminant analysis finds linear combinations of the quantitative variables that provide maximal separation between classes or groups. Given a classification variable and several quantitative variables, the CANDISC procedure derives canonical variables, linear combinations of the quantitative variables that summarize between-class variation in much the same way that principal components summarize total variation. † The CANDISC procedure performs a canonical discriminant analysis, computes squared Mahalanobis distances between class means, and performs both univariate and multivariate one-way analyses of variance. Two output data sets can be produced: one containing the canonical coefficients and another containing, among other things, scored canonical variables. The canonical coefficients output data set can be rotated by the FACTOR procedure. It is customary to standardize the canonical coefficients so that the canonical variables have means that are equal to zero and pooled within-class variances that are equal to one. PROC CANDISC displays both standardized and unstandardized canonical coefficients. Correlations between the canonical variables and the original variables as well as the class means for the canonical variables are also displayed; these correlations, sometimes known as loadings, are called canonical structures. The scored canonical variables output data set can be used in conjunction with ODS Graphics to plot pairs of canonical variables in order to aid visual interpretation of group differences.","help":"PROC CANDISC <ALL> <ANOVA> <BCORR> <BCOV> <BSSCP> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DISTANCE> <NCAN=n> <NOPRINT> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <PCORR> <PCOV> <PREFIX=name> <PSSCP> <SHORT> <SIMPLE> <SINGULAR=p> <STDMEAN> <TCORR> <TCOV> <TSSCP> <WCORR> <WCOV> <WSSCP>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tCLASS variable ;\n    \n\tFREQ variable;\n    \n\tPROB;\n    \n\tVAR;\n    \n\tWEIGHT variable;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ALL","optional":true,"description":"Activates all of the display options.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"ANOVA","optional":true,"description":"Displays univariate statistics for testing the hypothesis that the class means are equal in the population for each variable.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"BCORR","optional":true,"description":"Displays between-class correlations.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"BCOV","optional":true,"description":"Displays between-class covariances.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"BSSCP","optional":true,"description":"Displays the between-class SSCP matrix.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the data set to be analyzed.
