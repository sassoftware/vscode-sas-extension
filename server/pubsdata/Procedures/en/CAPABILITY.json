{"name":"CAPABILITY","statements":[{"name":"PROC CAPABILITY","description":"A process capability analysis compares the distribution of output from an in-control process to its specification limits to determine the consistency with which the specifications can be met. The CAPABILITY procedure provides the following: † o process capability indices, such as Cp and Cpk o descriptive statistics based on moments, including skewness and kurtosis. Other descriptive information provided includes quantiles or percentiles (such as the median), frequency tables, and details on extreme values. o histograms and comparative histograms. Optionally, these can be superimposed with specification limits, fitted probability density curves for various distributions, and kernel density estimates. o cumulative distribution function plots (cdf plots). Optionally, these can be superimposed with specification limits and probability distribution curves for various distributions. o quantile-quantile plots (Q-Q plots), probability plots, and probability-probability plots (P-P plots). These plots facilitate the comparison of a data distribution with various theoretical distributions. Optionally, Q-Q plots and probability plots can be superimposed with specification limits. o goodness-of-fit tests for a variety of distributions including the normal. The assumption of normality is critical to the interpretation of capability indices. o statistical intervals (prediction, tolerance, and confidence intervals) for a normal population o the ability to produce plots either as traditional graphics, ODS Graphics output, or legacy line printer plots. Traditional graphics can be saved, replayed, and annotated. o the ability to inset summary statistics and capability indices in graphical output o the ability to analyze data sets with a frequency variable o the ability to read specification limits from a data set o the ability to create output data sets containing summary statistics, capability indices, histogram intervals, parameters of fitted curves, and statistical intervals † You can use the PROC CAPABILITY statement, together with the VAR and SPEC statements, to compute summary statistics and process capability indices.","help":"PROC CAPABILITY <ALL> <ALPHA=value> <ANNOTATE=SAS-data-set> <CHECKINDICES<(<TEST = SW | KS | AD | CVM | NONE> <ALPHA=value>)>> <CIBASIC<(<TYPE=LOWER | UPPER | TWOSIDED><ALPHA=value>)>> <CIPCTLDF<(<TYPE=LOWER | UPPER | TWOSIDED><ALPHA=value>)>> <CIPCTLNORMAL<(<TYPE=LOWER | UPPER | TWOSIDED><ALPHA=value>)>> <CIPROBEX<(<TYPE=LOWER | UPPER | TWOSIDED><ALPHA=value>)>> <CPMA=value> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DEF=index> <EXCLNPWGT> <FORMCHAR(index)='string'> <FREQ> <GOUT=graphics-catalog> <LINEPRINTER> <LOCCOUNT> <MODES> <MU0=value(s)> <NEXTROBS=n> <NEXTRVAL=n> <NOPRINT> <NORMALTEST> <OUTTABLE=SAS-data-set> <PCTLDEF=1 | 2 | 3... > <ROBUSTSCALE> <ROUND=value-list> <SPECIALINDICES> <SPECS=SAS-data-set> <TRIMMED=values(s) <(TYPE=keyword><ALPHA=value>)>> <VARDEF=DF | N | WDF... > <WINSORIZED=values(s) <(TYPE=keyword><ALPHA=value>)>>;     \n\tBY variables;     \n\tCDFPLOT <ALPHA=value> <BETA<(beta-options)>> <BETA=value> ...; \n   \n\tCLASS <KEYLEVEL=value | ( value1 value2 )> <NOKEYMOVE> ORDER= ...;     \n\tCOMPHISTOGRAM <BARLABEL=<COUNT | PERCENT | PROPORTION>> <BARWIDTH=value> <C=value-list | MISE> ...;     \n\tFREQ variable; \n   \n\tHISTOGRAM <ALPHA=value> <BARLABEL=<COUNT | PERCENT | PROPORTION>> <BETA<(beta-options)>> ...; \n   \n\tID variable;     \n\tINSET <CFILL=color | BLANK> <CFILL=BLANK> <CFILLH=color> ...; \n   \n\tINTERVALS <ALPHA=value-list> <K=value-list> <METHODS=<1 | 2 | 3>... > ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT <OUT=SAS-data-set> <PCTLPRE=prefixes> <PCTLPTS=percentiles> ...; \n   \n\tPPPLOT <ALPHA=value-list> <BETA<(beta-options)>> <BETA=value> ...; \n   \n\tPROBPLOT <ALPHA=value-list | EST> <BETA(ALPHA=value | EST BETA=value | EST <beta-options>)> <BETA=value|EST> ...; \n   \n\tQQPLOT <ALPHA=value-list | EST> <BETA(ALPHA=value | EST BETA=value | EST <beta-options>)> <BETA=value|EST> ...; \n   \n\tSPEC <CLEFT=color> <CLSL=color> <CRIGHT=color> ...; \n   \n\tVAR;     \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"ALL","optional":true,"description":"Requests all of the tables generated by the FREQ, MODES, NEXTRVAL=5, CIBASIC, CIPCTLDF, and CIPCTLNORMAL options.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the default confidence level for all confidence limits computed by the CAPABILITY procedure.
