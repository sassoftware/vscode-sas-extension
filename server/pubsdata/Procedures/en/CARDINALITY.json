{"name":"CARDINALITY","statements":[{"name":"PROC CARDINALITY","description":"The term cardinality of a variable is an alias to the number of its distinct values. The term limited cardinality is the number of distinct values that do not exceed a certain threshold provided by the user. To make a decision about the role of a variable to be included in subsequent SAS analytics (class, interval), it is sufficient to aim only for the limited cardinality and not the full cardinality. We tend to make the same decision whether we computed the full or the limited cardinality. The limited cardinality i s computationally less expensive than the full cardinality, especially for big data. † The CARDINALITY procedure creates the following: † o the cardinality data set, which contains the summary information for each variable and some additional statistics about numeric variables. o the details data set, which contains with the levels of each variable.","help":"PROC CARDINALITY <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <> <ORDER=ASC | DESC | ASCFMT... > <OUTCARD=CAS-libref.data-table> <OUTDETAILS=CAS-libref.data-table>;     \n\tFREQ variable ;\n    \n\tVAR <ORDER=<ASC | DESC | ASCFMT>... > ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC CARDINALITY to use.
