{"name":"CCDM","statements":[{"name":"PROC CCDM","description":"In many loss modeling applications, the loss events are analyzed by modeling the severity (magnitude) of loss and the frequency (count) of loss separately. The primary goal of preparing these models is to estimate the aggregate loss—that is, the total loss that occurs over a period of time for which the frequency model is applicable. For example, an insurance company might want to assess the expected and worst-case losses for a particular business line, such as automobile insurance, over an entire year given the models for the number of losses in a year and the severity of each loss. A bank might want to assess the value-at-risk (VaR), a measure of the worst-case loss, for a portfolio of assets given the frequency and severity models for each asset type.","help":"PROC CCDM <ADJUSTEDSEVERITY=symbol-name | ADJSEV=symbol-name> <COUNTSTORE=SAS-item-store> <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <IGNOREPARMCOVARIANCE> <MAXCOUNTDRAW=number | MAXCOUNT=number> <NOPRINT> <NPERTURBEDSAMPLES=number | NPERTURB=number> <NREPLICATES=number | NREP=number> <OUTDRAW=CAS-libref.data-table | OUTSAMPLE=CAS-libref.data-table> <PCTLDEF=1 | 2 | 3... > <PRINT <(global-display-option)> =display-optionPRINT <(global-display-option)> =(display-option …display-option)> <SEED=number> <SEVERITYEST=CAS-libref.data-table> <SEVERITYSTORE=SAS-item-store | SEVSTORE=SAS-item-store> <VARDEF=divisor>;     \n\tABORT <ABEND> <CANCEL> <CANCEL FILE> ...;     \n\tARRAY <_ALL_> <_NUMERIC_> <_TEMPORARY_> ...; \n   \n\tATTRIB <FORMAT=format> <INFORMAT=informat> <LABEL='label'> ...; \n   \n\tBY variable-list;     \n\tCALL routine(parameter-1<, ...parameter-n>);     \n\tCONTINUE; \n   \n\tDELETE;     \n\tDESCRIBE; \n   \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...; \n   \n\tDISPLAYOUT <INCLUDEALL> <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ...; \n   \n\tDO <OVER> <> <> ...; \n   \n\t;     \n\t; \n   \n\tDROP variable-list;     \n\tELSE <DO> <IF> <THEN> ...; \n   \n\tEND;     \n\tENDRSUBMIT; \n   \n\tERROR <message>;     \n\tEXECUTE; \n   \n\tEXTERNALCOUNTS <COUNT=count-variable> <ID=replication-id-variable> ; \n   \n\tFILE <DISK> <DUMMY> <LOG> ...; \n   \n\tFORMAT <DEFAULT=default-format> ; \n   \n\tGO TO label | GOTO label;     \n\tIF <DO> <THEN> <WHEN> ...; \n   \n\tINFILE <DATALINES4> <DATALINES> <DISK> ...; \n   \n\tINFORMAT <DEFAULT= default-informat> ; \n   \n\tINPUT <specification(s)><@|@@>; \n   \n\tKEEP variable-list;     \n\t; \n   \n\tLEAVE;     \n\tLENGTH <DEFAULT=n> ; \n   \n\tLINK label;     \n\tLIST; \n   \n\tLOCK <CLEAR> <LIST> ; \n   \n\tMERGE <ALTER=> <BUFNO=<n | nK | hexX>... > <END=variable> ...; \n   \n\tMISSING character(s);     \n\tMODIFY <END=variable> <KEY=index> <NOBS=variable> ...; \n   \n\tOTHERWISE <DO> ; \n   \n\tOUTPUT ADJSAMPLEVAR=variable-name | ADJSAMPLEVAR=(variable-name <…variable-name>) OUT=CAS-libref.data-table | OUTSAMPLE=CAS-libref.data-table SAMPLEVAR=variable-name ...;     \n\tOUTSUM <KURTOSIS|KURT < =variable-name >> <MEAN < =variable-name >> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table | OUTSUM=CAS-libref.data-table> ...; \n   \n\tPAGE;     \n\tPUT <_ALL_> <_INFILE_> <_ODS_> ...; \n   \n\tPUTLOG 'message';     \n\tRENAME old-name-1=new-name-1 ... <old-name-n=new-name-n>; \n   \n\tREPLACE <data-set-name-1><...data-set-name-n>; \n   \n\tRETAIN <element-list(s) <initial-value(s) |; \n   \n\tRETURN;     \n\tRSUBMIT <options>; ENDRSUBMIT <CANCEL>;     \n\t; \n   \n\tSET <END=variable> <INDSNAME=variable> <KEY=index</UNIQUE>> ...; \n   \n\tSEVERITYMODEL <DEFINITIONSTABLE=\"CAS-table-name\" <(CASLIB=\"caslib\")> | SEVDEF=\"CAS-table-name\" <(CASLIB=\"caslib\")>> ;   \n \n\tSKIP <n>;     \n\tSTOP; \n   \n\tWHEN <DO> ;     \n\tWHERE where-expression-1; ","arguments":[{"name":"ADJUSTEDSEVERITY=","optional":true,"aliases":["ADJSEV="],"description":"Syntax: ADJUSTEDSEVERITY=symbol-name | ADJSEV=symbol-name ADJUSTEDSEVERITY=(symbol-name <…symbol-name>) | ADJSEV=(symbol-name <…symbol-name>) Names one or more symbols that represent an adjusted severity value in the SAS programming statements that you specify.
