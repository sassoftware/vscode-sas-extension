{"name":"CLUSTER","statements":[{"name":"PROC CLUSTER","description":"The CLUSTER procedure hierarchically clusters the observations in a SAS data set by using one of 11 methods. The data can be coordinates or distances. If the data are coordinates, PROC CLUSTER computes (possibly squared) Euclidean distances. If you want non-Euclidean distances, use the DISTANCE procedure to compute an appropriate distance data set that can then be used as input to PROC CLUSTER. † The clustering methods are: average linkage, the centroid method, complete linkage, density linkage (including Wong’s hybrid and th-nearest-neighbor methods), maximum likelihood for mixtures of spherical multivariate normal distributions with equal variances but possibly unequal mixing proportions, the flexible-beta method, McQuitty’s similarity analysis, the median method, single linkage, two-stage density linkage, and Ward’s minimum-variance method. † All methods are based on the usual agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure. Each observation begins in a cluster by itself. The two closest clusters are merged to form a new cluster that replaces the two old clusters. Merging of the two closest clusters is repeated until only one cluster is left. The various clustering methods differ in how the distance between two clusters is computed.","help":"PROC CLUSTER <BETA=n> <CCC> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DIM=n> <HYBRID> <K=n> <METHOD=AVERAGE|AVE | CENTROID|CEN | COMPLETE|COM... > <MODE=n> <NOEIGEN> <NOID> <NONORM> <NOPRINT> <NOSQUARE> <NOTIE> <OUTTREE=SAS-data-set> <PENALTY=p> <> <PRINT=n> <PSEUDO> <R=n> <RMSSTD> <RSQUARE> <SIMPLE> <STANDARD> <TRIM=p>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCOPY variables ;     \n\tFREQ variable;     \n\tID variable ; \n   \n\tRMSSTD variable ;     \n\tVAR variables ; ","arguments":[{"name":"BETA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the beta parameter for METHOD=FLEXIBLE.
