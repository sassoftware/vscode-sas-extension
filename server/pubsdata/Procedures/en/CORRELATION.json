{"name":"CORRELATION","statements":[{"name":"PROC CORRELATION","description":"The CORRELATION procedure computes Pearson correlation coefficients and the probabilities associated with these statistics in SAS Viya. † The Pearson product-moment correlation is a parametric measure of a linear relationship between two variables. When only one set of analysis variables is specified, the default correlation analysis includes descriptive statistics for each analysis variable and pairwise Pearson correlation statistics for these variables. When two sets of analysis variables are specified, the default correlation analysis includes descriptive statistics for each analysis variable and pairwise Pearson correlation statistics between the two sets of variables. When the relationship between two variables is nonlinear or when outliers are present, the correlation coefficient might incorrectly estimate the strength of the relationship.","help":"PROC CORRELATION <ALPHA> <BEST=n> <COV> <CSSCP> <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <EXCLNPWGT> <NOCORR> <NOMISS> <NOPROB> <NOSIMPLE> <OUTP=CAS-libref.data-table> <RANK> <SSCP> <VARDEF=DF | N | WDF... >;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...; \n   \n\tDISPLAYOUT <INCLUDEALL> <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ...; \n   \n\tFREQ variable;     \n\tVAR variables;     \n\tWEIGHT variable; \n   \n\tWITH variables; ","arguments":[{"name":"ALPHA","optional":true,"description":"Calculates and prints Cronbach’s coefficient alpha.

The procedure processes the DISPLAY statement on a CAS server and thus sends only a subset of ODS tables to the SAS client.
