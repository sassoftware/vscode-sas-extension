{"name":"CORRESP","statements":[{"name":"PROC CORRESP","description":"The CORRESP procedure performs simple correspondence analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). You can use correspondence analysis to find a low-dimensional graphical representation of the rows and columns of a crosstabulation or contingency table. Each row and column is represented by a point in a plot determined from the cell frequencies. PROC CORRESP can also compute coordinates for supplementary rows and columns. † PROC CORRESP can read two kinds of input: raw categorical responses on two or more classification variables or a two-way contingency table.
