Both procedures analyze univariate limited dependent variable models in which dependent variables take discrete values or are observed within only a limited range of values. Unlike the QLIM procedure, which can be run only on a single workstation, the CQLIM procedure takes advantage of a distributed computing environment that enables it to distribute the optimization task to one or more nodes. In addition, each node can use one or more threads to perform the optimization on its subset of the data. When several nodes are used and each node uses several threads to carry out its part of the work, the result is a highly parallel computation that can provide a dramatic gain in performance.","help":"PROC CQLIM <CORRB> <COVB> <COVEST=OP | HESSIAN | QML> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <ITPRINT>;     \n\tBOUNDS bound1 < , bound2 ...> ; \n   \n\tBY variables ;     \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <MISSING> <ORDER=<FORMATTED | FREQ | INTERNAL>> ...; \n   \n\tENDOGENOUS <CENSORED <(censored-options )>> <DISCRETE <(discrete-options)>> <DISTRIBUTION=<LOGISTIC | NORMAL>> ...; \n   \n\tFREQ variable ;     \n\tHETERO <LINK=<EXP | LINEAR>> <NOCONST> <SQUARE> ...; \n   \n\tINIT initvalue1 < , initvalue2 ...> ; \n   \n\tMODEL <DISCRETE <(discrete-options)>> <NOINT> <ORDER=<FORMATTED | FREQ | INTERNAL>> ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT <CONDITIONAL> <COPYVAR=SAS-variable-names | COPYVARS=(SAS-variable-names)> <OUT=SAS-data-set> ...; \n   \n\tRESTRICT restriction1 <, restriction2 ...> ; \n   \n\tTEST <ALL> <LM> <LR> ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT <NONORMALIZE> ; ","arguments":[{"name":"CORRB","optional":true,"description":"Prints the correlation matrix of the parameter estimates.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"COVB","optional":true,"description":"Prints the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"COVEST=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the method to calculate the covariance matrix of parameter estimates.
