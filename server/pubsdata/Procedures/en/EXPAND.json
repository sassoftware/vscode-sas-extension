{"name":"EXPAND","statements":[{"name":"PROC EXPAND","description":"The EXPAND procedure converts time series from one sampling interval or frequency to another and interpolates missing values in time series. A wide array of data transformations is also supported. Using PROC EXPAND, you can collapse time series data from higher frequency intervals to lower frequency intervals, or expand data from lower frequency intervals to higher frequency intervals. For example, quarterly values can be aggregated to produce an annual series, or quarterly estimates can be interpolated from an annual series. † Time series frequency conversion is useful when you need to combine series with different sampling intervals into a single data set. For example, if you need as input to a monthly model a series that is only available quarterly, you might use PROC EXPAND to interpolate the needed monthly values. † You can also interpolate missing values in time series, either without changing series frequency or in conjunction with expanding or collapsing the series.","help":"PROC EXPAND <ALIGN=BEGINNING|BEG|B | MIDDLE|MID|M | ENDING|END|E> <DATA= SAS-data-set> <EXTRAPOLATE> <FACTOR= n | FACTOR=( n : m )> <FROM=DAY | HOUR | MINUTE... > <OBSERVED=TOTAL | AVERAGE | BEGINNING... > <OUT= SAS-data-set> <OUTEST= SAS-data-set> <PLOTS=INPUT | TRANSFORMIN | CROSSINPUT... > <TO=DAY | HOUR | MINUTE... >;     \n\tBY variables ;     \n\tCONVERT <METHOD=<SPLINE(constraint<, constraint>) | JOIN | STEP>... > <OBSERVED=<TOTAL | AVERAGE | BEGINNING>... > <TRANSFORMIN=(operation ...)> ...;     \n\tID variable ; ","arguments":[{"name":"ALIGN=","optional":true,"description":"Controls the alignment of SAS dates used to identify output observations.

Moreover, there should be no duplicate observations, and no two observations should have ID values within the same time interval as defined by the FROM= option. If the ID statement is omitted, SAS date or datetime values are generated to label the input observations. These ID values are generated by assuming that the input data set starts at a SAS date value of 0, that is, 1 January 1960. This default starting date is then incremented for each observation by the FROM= interval (using the same logic as DATA step INTNX function). If the FROM= option is not specified, the ID values are generated as the observation count minus 1. When the ID statement is not used, an ID variable is added to the output data set named either DATE or DATETIME, depending on the value specified in the TO= option. If neither the TO= option nor the FROM= option is given, the ID variable in the output data set is named TIME.","help":"ID variable "}],"supportSiteInformation":{"docsetId":"etsug","docsetVersion":"latest","docsetTargetFile":"etsug_expand_toc.htm"}}
