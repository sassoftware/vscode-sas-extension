{"name":"FASTCLUS","statements":[{"name":"PROC FASTCLUS","description":"The FASTCLUS procedure performs a disjoint cluster analysis on the basis of distances computed from one or more quantitative variables. The observations are divided into clusters such that every observation belongs to one and only one cluster; the clusters do not form a tree structure as they do in the CLUSTER procedure. If you want separate analysis for different numbers of clusters, you can run PROC FASTCLUS once for each analysis. Alternatively, to do hierarchical clustering on a large data set, use PROC FASTCLUS to find initial clusters, and then use those initial clusters as input to PROC CLUSTER.","help":"PROC FASTCLUS <BINS=n> <CLUSTER=name> <CLUSTERLABEL=name> <CONVERGE=c> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DELETE=n> <DISTANCE> <DRIFT> <HC=c> <HP=p1 <p2>> <IMPUTE> <INSTAT=SAS-data-set> <IRLS> <LEAST=1 | 2 | MAX... > <LIST> MAXCLUSTERS=n <MAXITER=n> <MEAN=SAS-data-set> <NOMISS> <NOPRINT> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <OUTITER> <OUTSEED=SAS-data-set> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> RADIUS=t <RANDOM=n> <REPLACE=FULL | PART | NONE... > <SEED=SAS-data-set> <SHORT> <STRICT=s> <SUMMARY> <VARDEF=DF | N | WDF... >;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tFREQ variable;     \n\tID variable ;     \n\tVAR variable(s);  \n  \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"MAXCLUSTERS=","aliases":["MAXC="],"description":"Specifies the maximum number of clusters permitted.
