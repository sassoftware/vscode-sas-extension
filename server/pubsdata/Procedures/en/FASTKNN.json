This statement is similar to the ODS SELECT, ODS EXCLUDE, and ODS TRACE statements. However, the DISPLAY statement can improve performance when a large number of tables could be generated (such as in BY-group processing). The procedure processes the DISPLAY statement on a CAS server and thus sends only a subset of ODS tables to the SAS client. Because ODS statements are processed on a SAS client, all the display tables generated are first sent to the client and then the client creates a subset. If both DISPLAY and ODS statements are used together, the DISPLAY statement takes precedence over the ODS statements.","help":"DISPLAY &lt;CASESENSITIVE&gt; &lt;EXCLUDE&gt; &lt;EXCLUDEALL&gt; ...","arguments":[{"name":"CASESENSITIVE","optional":true,"followsDelimiter":"/","description":"Performs a case-sensitive comparison of table names in the table-list to display table names when tables are subsetted for display.
