The FISM procedure finds frequent patterns by using the FP-growth (frequent-pattern growth) algorithm of Han, Pei, and Yin (2000). The FP-growth algorithm uses a special data structure called the frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree), which retains the item set association information. â€  The FISM procedure is used by other procedures such as the MBANALYSIS procedure for association rule mining.","help":"PROC FISM <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <ITEMS=number> <NFIS_RANGE=(number, number)> <PCTSUP=number | SUPPCT=number | SUP_PCT=number | PCTSUPPORT=number> <SUPPORT=number>;     \n\tCUSTOMER variable;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> <OUTFREQ=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n    \n\tTARGET variable;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC FISM to use.
