The FMM procedure can estimate by maximum likelihood the parameters of all models supported by the procedure. Bayes estimation, on the other hand, is available for only a subset of these models. In Bayesian analysis, it is essential to examine the convergence of the Markov chains before you proceed with posterior inference. With ODS Graphics turned on, the FMM procedure produces graphs at the end of the procedure output; these graphs enable you to visually examine the convergence of the chain. Inferences cannot be made if the Markov chain has not converged. The output produced for a Bayesian analysis is markedly different from that for a frequentist (maximum likelihood) analysis for the following reasons: o Parameter estimates do not have the same interpretation in the two analyses. Parameters are fixed unknown constants in the frequentist context and random variables in a Bayesian analysis. o The results of a Bayesian analysis are summarized through chain diagnostics and posterior summary statistics and intervals. o The FMM procedure samples the mixing probabilities in Bayesian models directly, rather than mapping them onto a logistic (or other) scale. The FMM procedure applies highly specialized sampling algorithms in Bayesian models. For single-component models without effects, a conjugate sampling algorithm is used where possible. For models in the exponential family that contain effects, the sampling algorithm is based on Gamerman (1997). For the normal and t distributions, a conjugate sampler is the default sampling algorithm for models with and without effects. In multi-component models, the sampling algorithm is based on latent variable sampling through data augmentation (Frühwirth-Schnatter 2006) and the Gamerman or conjugate sampler.
