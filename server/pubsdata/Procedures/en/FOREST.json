{"name":"FOREST","statements":[{"name":"PROC FOREST","description":"The FOREST procedure creates a predictive model called a forest (which consists of several decision trees) in SAS Viya. A predictive model defines a relationship between input variables and a target variable. The purpose of a predictive model is to predict a target value from inputs. The FOREST procedure trains the model; that is, it creates the model by using training data in which the target values are known. The model can then be applied to observations in which the target is unknown. If the predictions fit the new data well, the model is said to generalize well. Good generalization is the primary goal for predictive tasks. A predictive model might fit the training data well but generalize poorly.","help":"PROC FOREST <ASSIGNMISSING=USEINSEARCH | MACSMALL | NONE> <BINMETHOD=BUCKET | QUANTILE> DATA=CAS-libref.data-table <INBAGFRACTION=number> <INMODEL=< CAS-libref. >data-table> <ISOLATION <(SAMPLEN=number)>> <LOH=L> <MAXBRANCH=b> <MAXDEPTH=number> <MINLEAFSIZE=number> <MINUSEINSEARCH=number> <NOPRINT> <NTREES=number> <NUMBIN=number> <OUTMODEL=<CAS-libref. >data-table> <PRINTTARGET> <RBAIMP> <SEED=number> <VARS_TO_TRY=m | M=m> <VII=2 | 3> <VOTE=MAJORITY | PROBABILITY>;     \n\tAUTOTUNE <EVALHISTORY=<ALL | LOG | NOE>... > <FRACTION=number> <KFOLD=number> ...;\n    \n\tCODE <COMMENT> <FILE=filename> <FORMATWIDTH=width> ...;\n    \n\tCROSSVALIDATION <KFOLD=number> ;\n    \n\tGROW <CHAID < (options) >> <CHISQUARE < (options) >> <ENTROPY (<options>) | GAIN < option >> ...;\n    \n\tID variables;\n    \n\tINPUT <LEVEL=<NOMINAL | INTERVAL>> ;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <COPYVAR=variable | COPYVARS=(variables)> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n    \n\tPARTITION <FRACTION(< TEST=fraction > < VALIDATE=fraction > < SEED=number >)> <ROLE=|ROLEVAR=variable (< TEST='value' > < TRAIN='value' > < VALIDATE='value' >)> ;\n    \n\tSAVESTATE <RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n    \n\tTARGET <LEVEL=<NOMINAL | INTERVAL>> ;\n    \n\tWEIGHT variable;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","description":"Names the input data table for PROC FOREST to use.
