They relax the generalized linear models’ assumption of linearity by allowing spline terms that characterize nonlinear dependency structures. Each spline term is constructed by the thin-plate regression spline technique (Wood 2003). A roughness penalty is applied to each spline term by a smoothing parameter that controls the balance between goodness of fit and the roughness of the spline curve. PROC GAMMOD fits models for standard distributions in the exponential family, such as the normal, Poisson, gamma and Tweedie distributions.","help":"PROC GAMMOD <ALPHA=number> <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <ITDETAILS> <NOCLPRINT<=number>> <NOPRINT> <PLIKEOPTIONS(optimization-parameters)> <PLOTS=ALL | NONE | COMPONENTS> <SEED=number> <SINGCHOL=number> <SINGULAR=number> <SMOOTHOPTIONS(optimization-parameters)>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <MISSING> <ORDER=<FORMATTED | FREQ | INTERNAL>> ...;\n    \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...;\n    \n\tDISPLAYOUT <INCLUDEALL> <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ...;\n    \n\tFREQ variable;\n    \n\tMODEL DESCENDING EVENT='<category>'|FIRST|LAST  ORDER=FORMATTED|FREQ|INTERNAL  ...;\n    \n\tOUTPUT LINP LOWER OUT=CAS-libref.data-table ...;\n    \n\tWEIGHT variable;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies a global significance level for the hypothesis testing of smoothing components and the construction of Bayesian confidence bands of predictions.
