{"name":"GANTT","statements":[{"name":"PROC GANTT","description":"The GANTT procedure produces a Gantt chart that is a graphical scheduling tool for the planning and control of a project. In its most basic form, a Gantt chart is a bar chart that plots the tasks of a project versus time. PROC GANTT displays a Gantt chart corresponding to a project schedule such as that produced by the CPM procedure or one that is input directly to the procedure, and it offers several options and statements for tailoring the chart to your needs. â€  Using PROC GANTT, you can plot the predicted early and late schedules and identify critical, supercritical, and slack activities. In addition, you can visually monitor a project in progress with the actual schedule and compare the actual schedule against a target baseline schedule. You can also graphically view the effects of scheduling a project subject to resource limitations. Any combination of these schedules can be viewed simultaneously (provided the relevant data exist) together with any user-specified variables of interest, such as project deadlines and other important dates. PROC GANTT enables you to display the early, late, and actual schedules in a single bar to produce a more meaningful schedule for tracking an activity in progress.","help":"PROC GANTT <ANNOTATE=SAS-data-set><CALEDATA=SAS-data-set><DATA=SAS-data-set><FULLSCREEN><GOUT=graphics catalog><GRAPHICS><HOLIDATA=SAS-data-set><IMAGEMAP=SAS-data-set><LABDATA= | LABELDATA= | LABEL= SAS-data-set><LABMAXINT=n><LINEPRINTER><MAXDEC=n><PRECDATA=SAS-data-set><SPLIT='character'><WORKDATA= | WORKDAY= SAS-data-set>;     \n\tBY variables ;\n\tCHART <A_FINISH=variable><A_START=variable><B_FINISH=variable> ...;\n\tID variables ;","arguments":[{"name":"ANNOTATE=","optional":true,"aliases":["ANNO="],"description":"Specifies the input data set that contains the appropriate Annotate variables for the purpose of adding text and graphics to the Gantt chart.","help":"ANNOTATE=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"CALEDATA=","optional":true,"aliases":["CALENDAR="],"description":"Identifies a SAS data set that specifies the work pattern during a standard week for each of the calendars that is to be used in the project.","help":"CALEDATA=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the SAS data set that carries the schedule information to be used by PROC GANTT.","help":"DATA=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"FULLSCREEN","optional":true,"aliases":["FS"],"description":"Indicates that the Gantt chart be drawn in full-screen mode.
