For longitudinal studies, missing data are common, and they can be caused by dropouts or skipped visits. If missing responses depend on previous responses, the usual GEE approach can lead to biased estimates. So the GEE procedure also implements the weighted GEE method to handle missing responses that are caused by dropouts in longitudinal studies (Robins and Rotnitzky 1995; Preisser, Lohman, and Rathouz 2002). The GEE procedure in SAS/STAT 14.1 does not support the weighted GEE method for the multinomial distribution for polytomous responses.","help":"PROC GEE <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DESCENDING> <NAMELEN=number> <PLOTS=ALL | HISTOGRAM | NONE>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <ORDER=<DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ>... > ; \n   \n\tESTIMATE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | SCHEFFE | SIDAK>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tFREQ | FREQUENCY variable;     \n\tLSMEANS <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | DUNNETT | NELSON>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tMISSMODEL <MAXWEIGHT=number> <TYPE=<OBSLEVEL | SUBLEVEL>> ; \n   \n\tMODEL <ALPHA=number> <DIST=<BINOMIAL | GAMMA | IGAUSSIAN>... > <LINK=<CLOGLOG | CUMCLL | CUMLOGIT>... > ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT <LOWER=> OUT=SAS-data-set <PREDICTED=> ...; \n   \n\tREPEATED <ALPHAINIT=numbers> <CONVERGE=number> SUBJECT=subject-effect ...;     \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the SAS data set containing the data to be analyzed.
