{"name":"GLMPOWER","statements":[{"name":"PROC GLMPOWER","description":"Power and sample size analysis optimizes the resource usage and design of a study, improving chances of conclusive results with maximum efficiency. The GLMPOWER procedure performs prospective power and sample size analysis for linear models, with a variety of goals: † o determining the sample size required to get a significant result with adequate probability (power) † o characterizing the power of a study to detect a meaningful effect † o conducting what-if analyses to assess sensitivity of the power or required sample size to other factors † Here prospective indicates that the analysis pertains to planning for a future study. This is in contrast to retrospective analysis for a past study, which is not supported by this procedure. † The statistical analyses that are covered include Type III tests and contrasts of fixed effects in univariate linear models, optionally with covariates. The covariates can be continuous or categorical. Tests and contrasts involving random effects are not supported.","help":"PROC GLMPOWER <DATA=SAS-data-set> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <PLOTONLY>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS variables ;     \n\tCONTRAST <SINGULAR=number> ; \n   \n\tMANOVA M=equation,...,equation | (row-of-matrix,...,row-of-matrix) <ORTH> ; \n   \n\tMODEL dependents = independents ;  \n  \n\tPLOT INTERPOL=JOIN|NONE  KEY=BYCURVE|BYFEATURE|ONCURVES  MARKERS=ANALYSIS|COMPUTED|NICE...  ...;     \n\tPOWER <ALPHA=number-list> <CORRMAT=name-list> <CORRS=name-list> ...; \n   \n\tREPEATED factor-specification;     \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names a SAS data set to be used as the exemplary data set, which is an artificial data set constructed to represent the intended sampling design and the conjectured response means for the underlying population.","help":"DATA=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"ORDER=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the sorting order for the levels of all classification variables (specified in the CLASS statement).","help":"ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ | INTERNAL","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"DATA","description":"Levels are sorted by the order of appearance in the input data set.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"FORMATTED","description":"Levels are sorted by the external formatted value, except for numeric variables with no explicit format, which are sorted by their unformatted (internal) value.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"FREQ","description":"Levels are sorted by the descending frequency count; levels with the most observations come first in the order.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"INTERNAL","description":"Levels are sorted by the unformatted value.","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"PLOTONLY","optional":true,"description":"Specifies that only graphical results from the PLOT statement be produced.","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"BY","description":"You can specify a BY statement with PROC GLMPOWER to obtain separate analyses for observations in groups defined by the BY variables.
