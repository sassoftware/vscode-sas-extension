This model can be regarded as generalizing k-means clustering to incorporate information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the centers of the latent Gaussians.","help":"PROC GMM <ALPHA=number> <CLUSTERCOVOUT=CAS-libref.data-table> <CLUSTERSUMOUT=CAS-libref.data-table> <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <INFERENCE=VB <suboptions>> <MAXCLUSTERS=number> <NTHREADS=number-of-threads> <SEED=number>;     \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...;\n    \n\tDISPLAYOUT <INCLUDEALL> <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ...;\n    \n\tINPUT variables;\n    \n\tSAVESTATE <RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n    \n\tSCORE <COPYVAR=variable | COPYVARS=(variables)> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the mass parameter of the Dirichlet process.
