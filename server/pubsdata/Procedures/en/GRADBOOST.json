{"name":"GRADBOOST","statements":[{"name":"PROC GRADBOOST","description":"The GRADBOOST procedure creates a predictive model called a gradient boosting model in SAS Viya. A gradient boosting model consists of multiple decision trees. A predictive model defines a relationship between input variables and a target variable. The purpose of a predictive model is to predict a target value from inputs. The GRADBOOST procedure creates the model by using training data in which the target values are known. The model can then be applied to observations in which the target is unknown. If the predictions fit the new data well, the model is said to generalize well. Good generalization is the primary goal of predictive tasks. A predictive model might fit the training data well but generalize poorly.","help":"PROC GRADBOOST \n        <options>; \n\t\n          VIICODE \n          <options>;\n        \n\tAUTOTUNE \n          <options>;\n        \n\tCODE \n          <options>;\n        \n\tCROSSVALIDATION \n          <options>;\n        \n\tID \n          variables;\n        \n\tINPUT \n          variables\n          <options>;\n        \n\tOUTPUT \n          <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table>\n          <options>;\n        \n\tPARTITION \n          <options>;\n        \n\tSAVESTATE \n          <RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table>           ;\n        \n\tTARGET \n          <variable>\n          <LEVEL=<NOMINAL | INTERVAL>>           ;\n        \n\tTRANSFERLEARN \n          variable\n          <options>;\n        \n\tWEIGHT \n          variable;\n      ","arguments":[{"name":"ADDTREES","optional":true,"aliases":["ADDTREE"],"description":"Adds trees to an already generated gradient boosting model, which is specified in the INMODEL= option.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"ASSIGNMISSING=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies how to handle missing values during training and creates a splitting rule to handle missing values and unknown levels during scoring.
