The default value is STOPHORIZON=3. The stop horizon value is ignored if you also specify STOP=NONE or STOP=SL. For example, suppose that STOP=AIC and the sequence of AIC values at steps 1 to 6 of a selection are 10, 7, 4, 6, 5, 2. If STOPHORIZON=2, then the AIC criterion is deemed to have a local minimum at step 3 because the AIC value at the next two steps are greater than the value of 4 that occurs at step 3. However, if STOPHORIZON=3, then the value of step 3 is not deemed to be a local minimum because the AIC value at step 6 is lower than the AIC value at step 3.","help":"STOPHORIZON=*n*","type":"value"}]},{"name":"WEIGHT","description":"The variable in the WEIGHT statement is used as a weight to perform a weighted analysis of the data.
