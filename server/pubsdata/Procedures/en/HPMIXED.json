The HPMIXED procedure is specifically designed to cope with estimation problems involving a large number of fixed effects, a large number of random effects, or a large number of observations. † The HPMIXED procedure complements the MIXED procedure and other SAS/STAT procedures for mixed modeling. On the one hand, the models supported by the HPMIXED procedure are a subset of the models that you can fit with the MIXED procedure, and the confirmatory inferences available in the HPMIXED procedure are also a subset of the general analyses available with the MIXED procedure. On the other hand, the HPMIXED procedure can have considerably better performance than other SAS/STAT mixed modeling tools, in terms of memory requirements and computational speed.","help":"PROC HPMIXED <DATA=SAS-data-set> <INFOCRIT=NONE | PQ | Q> <ITDETAILS> <MAXCLPRINT=number> <METHOD=REML> <MMEQ> <NAMELEN=number> <NOCLPRINT<=number>> <NOFIT> <NOINFO> <NOITPRINT> <NOPRINT> <NOPROFILE> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <SINGCHOL=number> <SINGRES=number> <SINGULAR=number>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS <TRUNCATE> ; \n   \n\tCONTRAST <CHISQ> <DF=number> <E> ...; \n   \n\tEFFECT EFFECT-NAME=COLLECTION|LAG|MULTIMEMBER|MM...  <PERIOD=variable> <WITHIN=(variables) | WITHIN=variable> ...;     \n\tESTIMATE <ALPHA=number> <CL> <DIVISOR=number> ...; \n   \n\tID variables ;     \n\tLSMEANS <CL> <COV> <E> ...; \n   \n\tMODEL <ALPHA=number> <CL> <DDF=value-list> ...; \n   \n\tNLOPTIONS <ABSCONV= | ABSTOL=r> <ABSFCONV=r <n> | ABSFTOL=r<n>> <ABSGCONV= | ABSGTOL=r <n>> ...;     \n\tOUTPUT OUT=SAS-data-set PREDICTED= STDERR= ...;     \n\tPARMS <HOLD=value-list> <NOITER> <PARMSDATA=SAS-data-set> ...; \n   \n\tRANDOM <ALPHA=number> <CL> <GROUP=effect> ...; \n   \n\tREPEATED <GROUP=effect> <R<=value-list>> <RC<=value-list>> ...; \n   \n\tTEST <CHISQ> <E> <HTYPE=value-list> ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the SAS data set to be used by PROC HPMIXED.
