For more information about multilayer perceptron neural networks, see Bishop (1995). PROC HPNEURAL can also use the trained network to score the input data set. † PROC HPNEURAL reads and writes data in distributed form and makes full use of multicore computers and distributed computing environments to perform training and scoring. † Training a multilayer perceptron neural network requires the unconstrained minimization of a nonlinear objective function. Because there are currently no practical methods to guarantee finding a global minimum of that objective function, one way to be reasonably sure of finding a good solution is to train the network multiple times using different sets of initial values for the weights. Thus, even problems with smaller numbers of variables and training observations can benefit from the use of multicore computers and distributed computing environments.","help":"PROC HPNEURAL <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DISTR=ALL | SPLIT> <NOPRINT>;     \n\tARCHITECTURE <LAYER1> <LAYER1SKIP> <LOGISTIC> ...; \n   \n\tCODE <FILE=’external-file’ | fileref > ;     \n\tHIDDEN number ;     \n\tID variables ;     \n\tINPUT <LEVEL=<INT | NOM>> <MISSING=<MAP>> ; \n   \n\tPARTITION <FRACTION( TRAIN=number | VALIDATE=number )> <ROLEVAR=variable( TRAIN=value | VALIDATE=value )> ;     \n\tPERFORMANCE <COMMIT=n> <CPUCOUNT=<ACTUAL | <num>>> <DATASERVER=“name”> ...; \n   \n\tSCORE <MODEL=SAS-data-set> <OUT=SAS-data-set > ; \n   \n\tTARGET <LEVEL=<INT | NOM>> ; \n   \n\tTRAIN <MAXITER=number> <NUMTRIES=number> <VALID=_NONE_> ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT <_INVERSE_PRIORS_> ; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the SAS data set that contains the training and validation observations to be used by PROC HPNEURAL to train the neural network or that contains the observations to be scored when you are performing stand-alone scoring.
