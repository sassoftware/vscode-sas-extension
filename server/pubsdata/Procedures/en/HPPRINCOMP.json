It is a high-performance version of the PRINCOMP procedure in SAS/STAT software, but it provides additional iterative methods to calculate the principal components. † Principal component analysis is a multivariate technique for examining relationships among several quantitative variables. The choice between using factor analysis and using principal component analysis depends in part on your research objectives. You should use the PRINCOMP procedure if you are interested in summarizing data and detecting linear relationships. You can use principal components to reduce the number of variables in regression, clustering, and so on.","help":"PROC HPPRINCOMP <COVARIANCE> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <METHOD=EIG | ITERGS | NIPALS> <N=number> <NOINT> <NOPRINT> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <PARPREFIX=|PPREFIX=|RPREFIX=name> <PREFIX=name> <SINGULAR=p> <STANDARD> <VARDEF=DF | N | WEIGHT|WGT... >;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCODE <CATALOG=library.catalog.entry.typeCAT=library.catalog.entry.type> <FILE= filename> <FORMAT=format> ...; \n   \n\tFREQ variable ;     \n\tID variables ;     \n\tOUTPUT <H <=prefix>> OUT=SAS-data-set | DATA=SAS-data-set <STD <=prefix>> ...; \n   \n\tPARTIAL variables ;     \n\tPERFORMANCE <COMMIT=n> <DETAILS> <GRIDHOST=\"name\"> ...; \n   \n\tVAR variables ;     \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"COVARIANCE","optional":true,"aliases":["COV"],"description":"Computes the principal components from the covariance matrix.
