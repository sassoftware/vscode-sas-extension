The models supported are standard independently and identically distributed general linear models, which can contain main effects that consist of both continuous and classification variables and interaction effects of these variables. The procedure offers extensive capabilities for customizing the model selection with a wide variety of selection and stopping criteria, from traditional and computationally efficient significance-level-based criteria to more computationally intensive validation-based criteria. PROC HPREG also provides a variety of regression diagnostics that are conditional on the selected model. † With the HPREG procedure you can read and write data in distributed form and perform analyses in parallel in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) or massively parallel processing (MPP) mode.","help":"PROC HPREG <ALPHA=number> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <FMTLIBXML=file-ref> <NAMELEN=number> <NOCLPRINT< =number >> <NOPRINT> <SEED=number>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <ORDER=<DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ>... > <REF=<<'level'> | FIRST | LAST>> ...; \n   \n\tCODE <CATALOG=library.catalog.entry.type> <DUMMIES> <NODUMMIES> ...; \n   \n\tFREQ variable ;     \n\tID variables ;     \n\tMODEL <CLB> <NOINT> <ORDERSELECT> ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT <LINP> OUT=SAS-data-set | DATA=SAS-data-set PREDICTED ...;     \n\tPARTITION <FRACTION(<TEST=fraction> <VALIDATE=fraction>)> <ROLEVAR= | ROLE=variable(<TEST=’value’> <TRAIN=’value’> <VALIDATE=’value’>)> ; \n   \n\tPERFORMANCE <COMMIT=n> <CPUCOUNT=<ACTUAL | <num>>> <DATASERVER=“name”> ...; \n   \n\tSELECTION <ADAPTIVE <(GAMMA=nonnegative number)>> <CHOOSE=<AIC | AICC | SBC>> <METHOD=<BACKWARD | FORWARD | FORWARDSWAP>... > ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Sets the significance level used for the construction of confidence intervals.
