{"name":"HPSEVERITY","statements":[{"name":"PROC HPSEVERITY","description":"The HPSEVERITY procedure estimates parameters of any arbitrary continuous probability distribution that is used to model the magnitude (severity) of a continuous-valued event of interest. Some examples of such events are loss amounts paid by an insurance company and demand of a product as depicted by its sales. PROC HPSEVERITY is especially useful when the severity of an event does not follow typical distributions, such as the normal distribution, that are often assumed by standard statistical methods. † PROC HPSEVERITY provides a default set of probability distribution models that includes the Burr, exponential, gamma, generalized Pareto, inverse Gaussian (Wald), lognormal, Pareto, Tweedie, and Weibull distributions. In the simplest form, you can estimate the parameters of any of these distributions by using a list of severity values that are recorded in a SAS data set. PROC HPSEVERITY computes the estimates of the model parameters, their standard errors, and their covariance structure by using the maximum likelihood method. † PROC HPSEVERITY can fit multiple distributions at the same time and choose the best distribution according to a specified selection criterion. Four different statistics of fit can be used as selection criteria. They are log likelihood, Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), corrected Akaike’s information criterion (AICC), and Schwarz Bayesian information criterion (BIC). † You can request the procedure to output the status of the estimation process, the parameter estimates and their standard errors, the estimated covariance structure of the parameters, and the statistics of fit.","help":"PROC HPSEVERITY <COVOUT> <CRITERION | CRITERIA | CRIT=criterion-option> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <EDFALPHA=confidence-level> <EMPIRICALCDF | EDF=method> <INEST=SAS-data-set> <INITSAMPLE (initsample-option) | INITSAMPLE (initsample-option . . . initsample-option)> <INSTORE=store-name> <NAMELEN=number> <NOCLPRINT< =number >> <NOPRINT> <OBJECTIVE=symbol-name> <OUTCDF=SAS-data-set> <OUTEST=SAS-data-set> <OUTMODELINFO=SAS-data-set> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <OUTSTORE=store-name> <PLOTS=ALL | NONE | CDF... > <PRINT=ALL | ALLFITSTATS | CONVSTATUS... > <VARDEF=DF | N>;     \n\tABORT <ABEND> <CANCEL> <CANCEL FILE> ...;     \n\tARRAY <_ALL_> <_NUMERIC_> <_TEMPORARY_> ...; \n   \n\tATTRIB <FORMAT=format> <INFORMAT=informat> <LABEL='label'> ...; \n   \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCALL routine(parameter-1<, ...parameter-n>); \n   \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <ORDER=<DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ>... > <REF=<<'level'> | FIRST | LAST>> ...; \n   \n\tCONTINUE;     \n\tDELETE; \n   \n\tDESCRIBE;     \n\tDISPLAY <BELL> <BLANK> <NOINPUT> ...; \n   \n\tDIST _ALL_ _PREDEFINED_ _USER_ ...; \n   \n\tDO <OVER> <> <> ...; \n   \n\t;     \n\t; \n   \n\tDROP variable-list;     \n\tELSE <DO> <IF> <THEN> ...; \n   \n\tEND;     \n\tENDRSUBMIT; \n   \n\tERROR <message>;     \n\tEXECUTE; \n   \n\tFILE <DISK> <DUMMY> <LOG> ...; \n   \n\tFORMAT <DEFAULT=default-format> ; \n   \n\tGO TO label | GOTO label;     \n\tIF <DO> <THEN> <WHEN> ...; \n   \n\tINFILE <DATALINES4> <DATALINES> <DISK> ...; \n   \n\tINFORMAT <DEFAULT= default-informat> ; \n   \n\tINPUT <specification(s)><@|@@>; \n   \n\tKEEP variable-list;     \n\t; \n   \n\tLEAVE;     \n\tLENGTH <DEFAULT=n> ; \n   \n\tLINK label;     \n\tLIST; \n   \n\tLOCK <CLEAR> <LIST> ; \n   \n\tLOSS <LEFTCENSORED | LC=variable-name> <LEFTTRUNCATED | LT=variable-name> <RIGHTCENSORED | RC=variable-name> ...; \n   \n\tMERGE <ALTER=> <BUFNO=<n | nK | hexX>... > <END=variable> ...; \n   \n\tMISSING character(s);     \n\tMODIFY <END=variable> <KEY=index> <NOBS=variable> ...; \n   \n\tNLOPTIONS <ABSCONV= | ABSTOL=r> <ABSFCONV=r[n] | ABSFTOL=r[n> <ABSGCONV=r[n] | ABSGTOL=r[n> ...; \n   \n\tOTHERWISE <DO> ; \n   \n\tOUTPUT<data-set-name(s)>;     \n\tOUTSCORELIB <COMMONPACKAGE> <OUTBYID=SAS-data-set> <OUTLIB=fcmp-library-name> ...; \n   \n\tPAGE;     \n\tPERFORMANCE <COMMIT=n> <CPUCOUNT=<ACTUAL | <num>>> <DATASERVER=“name”> ...; \n   \n\tPUT <_ALL_> <_INFILE_> <_ODS_> ...; \n   \n\tPUTLOG 'message';     \n\tRENAME old-name-1=new-name-1 ... <old-name-n=new-name-n>; \n   \n\tREPLACE <data-set-name-1><...data-set-name-n>; \n   \n\tRETAIN <element-list(s) <initial-value(s) |; \n   \n\tRETURN;     \n\tRSUBMIT <options>; ENDRSUBMIT <CANCEL>;     \n\tSCALEMODEL <DFMIXTURE=<FULL | MEAN | QUANTILE>... > <OFFSET=offset-variable-name> ; \n   \n\t;     \n\tSET <END=variable> <INDSNAME=variable> <KEY=index</UNIQUE>> ...; \n   \n\tSKIP <n>;     \n\tSTOP; \n   \n\tWEIGHT variable-name ;     \n\tWHEN <DO> ; \n   \n\tWHERE where-expression-1; ","arguments":[{"name":"COVOUT","optional":true,"description":"Specifies that the OUTEST= data set contain the estimate of the covariance structure of the parameters.
