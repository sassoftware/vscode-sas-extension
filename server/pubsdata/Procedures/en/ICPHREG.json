{"name":"ICPHREG","statements":[{"name":"PROC ICPHREG","description":"The ICPHREG procedure is designed to fit proportional hazards regression models to interval-censored data. It can also fit proportional hazards regression models to failure time data that are uncensored, right censored, or left censored. † The ICPHREG procedure enables you to use a variety of configurations with respect to the baseline function to fit a proportional hazards model; these configurations include a piecewise constant model (Friedman 1982) and a cubic spline model (Royston and Parmar 2002). To estimate the regression coefficients and the baseline parameters, the ICPHREG procedure maximizes the full likelihood instead of the Cox partial likelihood. Standard errors of the estimates are obtained by inverting the observed information matrix, which is derived from the full likelihood. † The ICPHREG procedure also enables you to do the following: include an offset variable in the model, weight the observations in the input data, test linear hypotheses about the regression coefficients, compute customized hazard ratios, and estimate and plot the survival function and the cumulative hazard function for a new set of covariates. † The ICPHREG procedure uses ODS Graphics to create graphs as part of its output.","help":"PROC ICPHREG <ALPHA=number> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <ITHISTORY> <NAMELEN=n> <NLOPTIONS(options)> <NOPRINT> <NOTHREADS> <PLOTS=CUMHAZ | HAZARD | INTERVAL... > <SINGULAR=number | EPSILON=number> <THREADS=n | NTHREADS=n>;     \n\tBASELINE COVARIATES=SAS-data-set OUT=SAS-data-set TIMELIST=list ...;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS <CPREFIX=n> <DESCENDING> <LPREFIX=n> ...; \n   \n\tFREQ <NOTRUNCATE> ; \n   \n\tHAZARDRATIO <ALPHA=number> <AT (variable=ALL | REF | list <...variable=ALL | REF| list> )> <DIFF=<DISTINCT | PAIRWISE  | REFERENCE>> ...; \n   \n\tMODEL <ALPHA=value> <CORRB> <COVB> ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT INTERVAL= OUT=SAS-data-set RESDEV= ...; \n   \n\tSTRATA <MISSING> ; \n   \n\tTEST <E> <E1> <E2> ...; ","arguments":[{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the α level for 100(1 - α)% confidence limits.
