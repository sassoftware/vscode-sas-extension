{"name":"INBREED","statements":[{"name":"PROC INBREED","description":"The INBREED procedure calculates the covariance or inbreeding coefficients for a pedigree. PROC INBREED is unique in that it handles very large populations. † The INBREED procedure has two modes of operation. One mode carries out analysis on the assumption that all the individuals belong to the same generation. The other mode divides the population into nonoverlapping generations and analyzes each generation separately, assuming that the parents of individuals in the current generation are defined in the previous generation. † PROC INBREED also computes averages of the covariance or inbreeding coefficients within sex categories if the sex of individuals is known.","help":"PROC INBREED <AVERAGE> <COVAR> <DATA= SAS-data-set> <INDL> <IND> <INIT= cov> <MATRIXL> <MATRIX> <NOPRINT> <OUTCOV= SAS-data-set>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tCLASS variable ;\n    \n\tGENDER variable ;\n    \n\tMATINGS individual-list1 / mate-list1 <,..., individual-listn / mate-listn> ;\n    \n\tVAR individual parent1 parent2 <covariance> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"AVERAGE","optional":true,"description":"Produces a table of averages of coefficients for each pedigree of offspring.
