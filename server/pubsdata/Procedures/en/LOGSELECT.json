{"name":"LOGSELECT","statements":[{"name":"PROC LOGSELECT","description":"The LOGSELECT procedure fits binary and binomial response models in SAS Viya. † Logistic regression analysis is often used to investigate the relationship between discrete responses and a set of explanatory variables. † The logistic model shares a common feature with a more general class of linear models: a function g = g(µ) of the mean of the response variable is assumed to be linearly related to the explanatory variables. Because the mean µ implicitly depends on the stochastic behavior of the response and the explanatory variables are assumed to be fixed, the function g provides the link between the random (stochastic) component and the systematic (deterministic) component of the response variable Y. For this reason, Nelder and Wedderburn (1972) refer to g = g(µ) as a link function.","help":"PROC LOGSELECT <ABSCONV=r | ABSTOL=r> <ABSFCONV= r <n> | ABSFTOL=r <n>> <ABSGCONV=r <n> | ABSGTOL=r <n>> <ABSXCONV=r <n> | ABSXTOL=r <n>> <ALPHA=number> <CORRB> <COVB> <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <FCONV2=r <n> | FTOL2=r <n>> <FCONV=r <n> | FTOL=r <n>> <GCONV2=r <n> | GTOL2=r <n>> <GCONV=r <n> | GTOL=r <n>> <ITHIST> <LASSORHO=r> <LASSOSTEPS=n> <LASSOTOL=r> <MAXFUNC=n | MAXFU=n> <MAXITER=n | MAXIT=n> <MAXOPTBATCH=number> <MAXTIME=r> <MINITER=n | MINIT=n> <NOCHECK> <NOCLPRINT< =number >> <NORMALIZE=YES | NO> <NOSTDERR> <PARTFIT> <STB> <TECHNIQUE=CONGRA | DBLDOG | LEVMAR... > <XCONV=r | XTOL=r>;     \n\tBY variables ; \n   \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <MISSING> <ORDER=<FORMATTED | FREQ | INTERNAL>> ...; \n   \n\tCODE <COMMENT> <FILE=filename> <FORMATWIDTH=width> ...; \n   \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...; \n   \n\tDISPLAYOUT <INCLUDEALL> <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ...; \n   \n\tEFFECT NAME=COLLECTION|MULTIMEMBER|MM|POLYNOMIAL|POLY...  <PERIOD=variable> <WITHIN=(variables) | WITHIN=variable> ...;     \n\tFREQ variable ;     \n\tMODEL DESCENDING EVENT=<'category'>|FIRST|LAST  ORDER=FORMATTED|FREQ|INTERNAL  ...;     \n\tOUTPUT <ALL> <ALPHA=number> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> ...; \n   \n\tPARTITION <FRACTION(< TEST=fraction > < VALIDATE=fraction > < SEED=number >)> <ROLE=|ROLEVAR=variable (< TEST='value' > < TRAIN='value' > < VALIDATE='value' >)> ;     \n\tSELECTION <ADAPTIVE <(GAMMA=nonnegative number)>> <CHOOSE=<AIC | AICC | SBC>> <METHOD=<BACKWARD | FORWARD | FORWARDSWAP>... > ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"ABSCONV=","optional":true,"aliases":["ABSTOL="],"description":"Specifies an absolute function convergence criterion.
