{"name":"MBANALYSIS","statements":[{"name":"PROC MBANALYSIS","description":"The MBANALYSIS (market basket analysis) procedure performs association rule mining on a transaction database. Association rules are in the form of if A then B, where A and B are items in the transaction database. Association rules helps determine association or correlation between various items in a database. These rules are used for finding the latest trends and patterns in data and also help in business decision- making processes. The MBANALYSIS procedure uses the frequent-pattern growth (FP-growth) algorithm of Han, Pei, and Yin (2000) for finding frequent item sets and then generates rules that are based on these frequent item sets.","help":"PROC MBANALYSIS <ANTECEDENTLIST=(string <string...>)> <CONF=number> <CONSEQUENTLIST=(string <string...>)> <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <ITEMS=number> <LIFT=number> <MAXBSKTSZ=number> <MINBSKTSZ=number> <NLHS_RANGE=(number, number)> <NORM= | > <NRHS_RANGE=(number, number)> <PCTSUP=number | SUPPCT=number | SUP_PCT=number | PCTSUPPORT=number> <SEPARATOR=string> <SUP_LIFT=number>;     \n\tCUSTOMER statement;\n    \n\tHIERARCHY <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table <CAS-libref.data-table...>> ;\n    \n\tID variables;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> <OUTFREQ=CAS-libref.data-table> <OUTRULE=CAS-libref.data-table> ...;\n    \n\tSAVESTATE <RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n    \n\tTARGET variable;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ANTECEDENTLIST=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the regular expression strings to match in the antecedent (left-hand side) of a rule.","type":"value"},{"name":"CONF=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the minimum confidence for the rules, where number must be a real number between 0 and 100.","help":"CONF=*number*","type":"value"},{"name":"CONSEQUENTLIST=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the regular expression strings to match in the consequent (right-hand side) of a rule.","type":"value"},{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC MBANALYSIS to use.
