{"name":"MCMC","statements":[{"name":"PROC MCMC","description":"The MCMC procedure is a general purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation procedure that is designed to fit Bayesian models. Bayesian statistics is different from traditional statistical methods such as frequentist or classical methods. † In essence, Bayesian statistics treats parameters as unknown random variables, and it makes inferences based on the posterior distributions of the parameters. There are several advantages associated with this approach to statistical inference. Some of the advantages include its ability to use prior information and to directly answer specific scientific questions that can be easily understood.","help":"PROC MCMC <ACCEPTTOL=n> <ALG=HMC | NORMAL|N | NUTS... > <AUTOCORLAG=n> <BINARYJOINT> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DIAGNOSTICS=NONE | <(keyword-list)>> <DIC> <DISCRETE=BINNING | GEO> <INF=value> <INIT=(keyword-list)> <JOINTMODEL> <LIST> <LISTCODE> <MAXINDEXPRINT=number | ALL | MAXIPRINT=number | ALL> <MAXSUBVALUEPRINT=number | ALL | MAXSVPRINT=number | ALL> <MAXTUNE=n> <MCHISTORY=BRIEF | DETAILED | NONE> <MINTUNE=n> <MISSING=ALLCASE|AC | COMPLETECASE|CC> <MONITOR= (symbol-list)> <NBI=n> <NMC=n> <NOLOGDIST> <NTHREADS=n> <NTU=n> <OUTPOST=SAS-data-set> <PLOTS=ALL | AUTOCORR|ACF | DENSITY |D|KERNEL|K... > <PROPCOV=IND | CONGRA | DBLDOG... > <REOBSINFO <(display-options)>> <SCALE=value> <SEED=n> <SIMREPORT=n> <SINGDEN=value> <STATISTICS=ALL |  | CORR... > <TARGACCEPT=value> <TARGACCEPTI=value> <THIN=n> <TRACE> <TUNEWT=value>;     \n\tABORT <ABEND> <CANCEL> <CANCEL FILE> ...;     \n\tARRAY arrayname [ dimensions ] <$> <variables-and-constants> ; \n   \n\tBEGINCNST ;     \n\tBEGINHYPER ;     \n\tBEGINNODATA ; | BEGINPRIOR ; \n   \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCALL routine(parameter-1<, ...parameter-n>); \n   \n\tDELETE;     \n\tDO <OVER> <> <> ...; \n   \n\tELSE <DO> <IF> <THEN> ...; \n   \n\tEND;     \n\tENDCNST ; \n   \n\tENDHYPER ;     \n\tENDNODATA | ENDPRIOR ;     \n\tGOTO label; \n   \n\tHYPERPRIOR <beta(<a=>α, <b=>β)> <binary(<prob|p=>p)> <binomial(<n=>n, <prob|p=>p)> ...;     \n\tIF <DO> <THEN> <WHEN> ...; \n   \n\tLINK statement-label;     \n\tMODEL <beta(<a=>α, <b=>β)> <binary(<prob|p=>p)> <binomial(<n=>n, <prob|p=>p)> ...;     \n\t; \n   \n\tPARMS <NORMAL> <SLICE> <T<(df)>> ...; \n   \n\tPREDDIST <COVARIATES=SAS-data-set> <NSIM=n> <OUTPRED=SAS-data-set> ...; \n   \n\tPRIOR <beta(<a=>α, <b=>β)> <binary(<prob|p=>p)> <binomial(<n=>n, <prob|p=>p)> ...;     \n\tPUT <_PAGE_> ; \n   \n\tRANDOM <beta(<a=>α, <b=>β)> <binary(<prob|p=>p)> <gamma(<shape|sp=>α, scale|s=λ) | gamma(<shape|sp=>α, isscale|is=λ)> ...; \n   \n\tRETURN;     \n\t; \n   \n\tSTOP ;     \n\tUDS subroutine-name ( subroutine-argument-list) ;     \n\tWHEN <DO> ; ","arguments":[{"name":"ACCEPTTOL=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies a tolerance for acceptance probabilities.
