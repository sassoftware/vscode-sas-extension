A mixed linear model is a generalization of the standard linear model used in the GLM procedure, the generalization being that the data are permitted to exhibit correlation and nonconstant variability. The mixed linear model, therefore, provides you with the flexibility of modeling not only the means of your data (as in the standard linear model) but their variances and covariances as well. † The primary assumptions underlying the analyses performed by PROC MIXED are as follows: † o The data are normally distributed (Gaussian). † o The means (expected values) of the data are linear in terms of a certain set of parameters. † o The variances and covariances of the data are in terms of a different set of parameters, and they exhibit a structure matching one of those available in PROC MIXED.","help":"PROC MIXED <ABSOLUTE> <ALPHA=number> <ANOVAF> <ASYCORR> ASYCOV <CL<=WALD>> <CONVF<=number>> <CONVG<=number>> <CONVH<=number>> <COVTEST> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DFBW> <EMPIRICAL> <IC> <INFO> <ITDETAILS> <LOGNOTE> <MAXFUNC=number> <MAXITER=number> <METHOD=REML | ML | MIVQUE0... > <MMEQ> <MMEQSOL> <NAMELEN<=number>> <NOBOUND> <NOCLPRINT<=number>> <NOINFO> <NOITPRINT> <NOPROFILE> <ORD> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <PLOTS=ALL | BOXPLOT | DISTANCE... > <RANKS> <RATIO> <RIDGE=number> <SCORING<=number>>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS <REF=<FIRST | LAST>> <TRUNCATE> ; \n   \n\tCODE <CATALOG=library.catalog.entry.type> <DUMMIES> <NODUMMIES> ...; \n   \n\tCONTRAST <CHISQ> <DF=number> <E> ...; \n   \n\tESTIMATE <ALPHA=number> <CL> <DF=number> ...; \n   \n\tID variables ;     \n\tLSMEANS <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | DUNNETT | SCHEFFE>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tLSMESTIMATE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | SCHEFFE | SIDAK>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tMODEL <ALPHA=number> <ALPHAP=number> <CHISQ> ...; \n   \n\tPARMS <HOLD=value-list> <LOGDETH> <LOWERB=value-list> ...; \n   \n\tPRIOR DATA= FLAT JEFFREYS ...;     \n\tRANDOM <ALPHA=number> <CL> <G> ...; \n   \n\tREPEATED <GROUP=effect> <HLM> <HLPS> ...; \n   \n\tSLICE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | DUNNETT | NELSON>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tSTORE <LABEL='label'> <OUT=>item-store-name ;     \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"ASYCOV","description":"Requests that the asymptotic covariance matrix of the covariance parameters be displayed.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"ABSOLUTE","optional":true,"description":"Makes the convergence criterion absolute.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Requests that confidence limits be constructed for the covariance parameter estimates with confidence level 1-number.
