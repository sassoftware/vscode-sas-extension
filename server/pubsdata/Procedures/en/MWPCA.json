{"name":"MWPCA","statements":[{"name":"PROC MWPCA","description":"The MWPCA procedure implements moving windows robust principal component analysis. You can use this procedure to capture changes in principal components over time by using sliding windows. Also, you can choose to perform robust principal component analysis on each window; that is, the outliers and noise would be excluded from each window before the analysis is performed. † One important application of MWPCA is for detecting relative changes in parts of a system compared to the overall system. By tracing the principal components over time, you can determine whether significant changes in the principal components can be a cause for concern.","help":"PROC MWPCA <CENTER> <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <NTHREADS=number-of-threads> <ROBUST> <STEPSIZE=number> <WINDOWSIZE=number>;     \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...;\n    \n\tDISPLAYOUT <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ;\n    \n\tID variable;\n    \n\tINPUT variables;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <NPC=number> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> <STANDARDPC> ...;\n    \n\tRPCA <FIXEDMU> <LAMBDA=number specifies a value for ƛ, where number is a positive real number.> <LAMBDAWEIGHT=number> ...;\n    \n\tSVD <MAXRANK=number> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"CENTER","optional":true,"description":"Centers the observations by the mean of each column for each window.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC MWPCA to use.

This statement is similar to the ODS SELECT, ODS EXCLUDE, and ODS TRACE statements. However, the DISPLAY statement can improve performance when a large number of tables could be generated (such as in BY-group processing). The procedure processes the DISPLAY statement on a CAS server and thus sends only a subset of ODS tables to the SAS client. Because ODS statements are processed on a SAS client, all the display tables generated are first sent to the client and then the client creates a subset.
