{"name":"NETWORK","statements":[{"name":"PROC NETWORK","description":"The NETWORK procedure includes a number of graph theory and network analysis algorithms that can augment data mining and machine learning approaches. In many practical applications of data mining and machine learning models, pairwise interaction between the entities of interest in the model often plays an important role. For example, when you are modeling churn in a telecommunications network to support a retention campaign, the influence of individual customers on the other customers—such as friends and acquaintances that they regularly interact with—might contribute to the propensity of other customers to churn. You could likewise imagine a customer being able to influence the propensity of his or her acquaintances to acquire new products. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are obvious examples of networks that represent such interactions between individuals.","help":"PROC NETWORK <DIRECTION=DIRECTED | UNDIRECTED> <INCLUDESELFLINK> <INDEXOFFSET=number> <LINKS=CAS-libref.data-table> <LOGFREQTIME=number | LOGFREQUENCYTIME=number> <LOGLEVEL=NONE | BASIC | MODERATE... > <NODES=CAS-libref.data-table> <NODESSUBSET=CAS-libref.data-table> <NTHREADS=number> <OUTLINKS=CAS-libref.data-table> <OUTNODES=CAS-libref.data-table> <STANDARDIZEDLABELS> <TIMETYPE=CPU | REAL>;     \n\tBICONNECTEDCOMPONENTS ;     \n\tBY variables;     \n\tCENTRALITY <AUTH=<WEIGHT | UNWEIGHT | BOTH>> <BETWEEN=<WEIGHT | UNWEIGHT | BOTH>> <BETWEENNORM=<TRUE | FALSE>> ...; \n   \n\tCLIQUE <MAXCLIQUES=number | ALL> <MAXTIME=number> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> ...; \n   \n\tCOMMUNITY <ALGORITHM=<LOUVAIN | LABELPROP | PARALLELLABELPROP>> <INTERNALFORMAT=<FULL | THIN>> <LINKREMOVALRATIO=number> ...; \n   \n\tCONNECTEDCOMPONENTS <ALGORITHM=<AUTOMATIC | DFS | PARALLEL>... > <INTERNALFORMAT=<FULL | THIN>> ; \n   \n\tCORE <MAXTIME=number> ; \n   \n\tCYCLE <ALGORITHM=<BACKTRACK | BUILD>> <MAXCYCLES=number | ALL> <MAXLENGTH=number> ...; \n   \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...; \n   \n\tDISPLAYOUT <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ; \n   \n\tLINKSVAR <AUXWEIGHT=column> <FROM=column> <TO=column> ...; \n   \n\tNODESSUBSETVAR <NODE=column> <REACH=column> <SINK=column> ...; \n   \n\tNODESVAR <NODE=column> <WEIGHT=column> ; \n   \n\tREACH <DIGRAPH> <EACHSOURCE> <MAXREACH=number> ...; \n   \n\tSHORTESTPATH <MAXPATHWEIGHT=number> <OUTPATHS=CAS-libref.data-table | OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> <OUTWEIGHTS=CAS-libref.data-table> ...; \n   \n\tSUMMARY <BICONNECTEDCOMPONENTS> <CONNECTEDCOMPONENTS> <DIAMETERAPPROX=<WEIGHT | UNWEIGHT | BOTH>> ...; \n   \n\tTRANSITIVECLOSURE <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> ; ","arguments":[{"name":"DETERMINISTIC=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies whether to enforce determinism.","help":"DETERMINISTIC=TRUE |  FALSE","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"TRUE","description":"Ensures that each invocation (with the same machine configuration and parameter settings) produces the same final result.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"FALSE","description":"Specifying DETERMINISTIC=FALSE might improve performance, but the final results might differ.
