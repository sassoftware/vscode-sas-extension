{"name":"NPAR1WAY","statements":[{"name":"PROC NPAR1WAY","description":"PROC NPAR1WAY performs tests for location and scale differences based on the following scores of a response variable: Wilcoxon, median, Van der Waerden (normal), Savage, Siegel-Tukey, Ansari-Bradley, Klotz, Mood, and Conover. Additionally, PROC NPAR1WAY provides tests that use the raw input data as scores. When the data are classified into two samples, tests are based on simple linear rank statistics. When the data are classified into more than two samples, tests are based on one-way ANOVA statistics. Both asymptotic and exact p-values are available for these tests. PROC NPAR1WAY also provides Hodges-Lehmann estimation, including exact confidence limits for the location shift. † PROC NPAR1WAY computes empirical distribution function (EDF) statistics, which test whether the distribution of a variable is the same across different groups. These include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Cramer-von Mises test, and, when the data are classified into only two samples, the Kuiper test. Exact p-values are available for the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.","help":"PROC NPAR1WAY <AB < (ADJUST) >> <ADJUST> <ALIGN=STRATA < (option)>> <ALPHA=α> <ANOVA> <CONOVER> <CORRECT=NO> <D> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DSCF> <EDF> <FP < (REFCLASS = class-number | 'class-value' ) >> <HL < (REFCLASS = class-number | 'class-value' ) >> <KLOTZ < (ADJUST)>> <MEDIAN> <MISSING> <MOOD < (ADJUST)>> <NOPRINT> <PLOTS=ABBOXPLOT | ANOVABOXPLOT|ANOVA | CONOVERBOXPLOT|CONOVER... > <SAVAGE> <SCORES=DATA> <ST < (ADJUST)>> <VW> <WILCOXON>;     \n\tBY variables;     \n\tCLASS variable ;     \n\tEXACT AB CONOVER HL ...; \n   \n\tFREQ variable;     \n\tOUTPUT <AB> <ANOVA> <OUT=SAS-data-set> ...; \n   \n\tSTRATA <MEDIAN> <RANKS=<STRATUM | OVERALL>> <SAVAGE> ...; \n   \n\tVAR variables ; ","arguments":[{"name":"AB=","optional":true,"description":"Requests an analysis of Ansari-Bradley scores.","help":"AB=ADJUST","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"ADJUST","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"ADJUST","optional":true,"description":"Adjusts for location differences among classes before performing tests for scale differences.
