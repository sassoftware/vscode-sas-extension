{"name":"PANEL","statements":[{"name":"PROC PANEL","description":"The PANEL procedure analyzes a class of linear econometric models that commonly arise when time series and cross-sectional data are combined. This type of pooled data on time series cross-sectional bases is often referred to as panel data. Typical examples of panel data include observations in time on households, countries, firms, trade, and so on. For example, in the case of survey data on household income, the panel is created by repeatedly surveying the same households in different time periods (years). † The panel data models can be grouped into several categories depending on the structure of the error term. The error structures and the corresponding methods that the PANEL procedure uses to analyze data are as follows: † o one-way and two-way models o fixed-effects and random-effects models o autoregressive models o moving-average models","help":"PROC PANEL <BTWNG> <BTWNT> <CORRB> <COVB> <DASILVA> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <FIXONE> <FIXONETIME> <FIXTWO> <FULLER> <M=number> <NOINT> <NOPRINT> <OUTCORR> <OUTCOV> <OUTEST=SAS-data-set> <OUTTRANS=SAS-data-set> <PARKS> <PHI> <PLOTS=ACTSURFACE | ALL | FITPLOT... > <POOLED> <RANONE> <RANTWO> <RHO> <SINGULAR=number> <VCOMP=FB | NL | WH... >;     \n\tBY variables ;\n    \n\tCLAG <OUT= SAS-data-set> ;\n    \n\tCLASS <out= SAS-data-set> ;\n    \n\tFLATDATA BASE=(variable, variable, ..., variable) INDID=variable KEEP=(variable, variable, ..., variable) ...;\n    \n\tID cross-section-id time-series-id ;\n    \n\tINSTRUMENTS <CONSTANT> <CORRELATED=(variable, variable, ..., variable)> <DEPVAR> ...;\n    \n\tLAG <OUT= SAS-data-set> ;\n    \n\tMODEL <ARTEST=integer> <ATOL=number> <BANDOPT=<TRAILING | CENTERED | LEADING>> ...;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <OUT=SAS-data-set> <PREDICTED=name> <RESIDUAL=name> ...;\n    \n\tRESTRICT \"string\" equation <,equation2...> ;\n    \n\tSLAG <OUT= SAS-data-set> ;\n    \n\tTEST <ALL> <LM> <WALD> ...;\n    \n\tXLAG <OUT= SAS-data-set> ;\n    \n\tZLAG <OUT= SAS-data-set> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"BTWNG","optional":true,"description":"Specifies that a between-groups model be estimated.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"BTWNT","optional":true,"description":"Specifies that a between-time-periods model be estimated.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"CORRB","optional":true,"description":"Prints the matrix of estimated correlations between the parameter estimates.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"COVB","optional":true,"description":"Prints the matrix of estimated covariances between the parameter estimates.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"DASILVA","optional":true,"description":"Specifies that the model be estimated by using the Da Silva method, which assumes a mixed variance-component moving-average model for the error structure.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data set.
