Investigators follow subjects until they reach a prespecified endpoint (for example, death). However, subjects sometimes withdraw from a study, or the study is completed before the endpoint is reached. In these cases, the survival times (also known as failure times) are censored; subjects survived to a certain time beyond which their status is unknown. The uncensored survival times are sometimes referred to as event times.
