A WHERE expression is a type of SAS expression that defines a condition. In the DATA step and in procedures that use SAS data sets as input source, the WHERE expression is used to select observations for inclusion in the DATA step or in the analysis. In the PLM procedure, which does not accept a SAS data set but rather takes an item store that was created by a qualifying SAS/STAT procedure, the WHERE statement is also used to specify conditions. The conditional selection does not apply to observations in PROC PLM, however. Instead, you use the WHERE statement in the PLM procedure to select a subset of BY groups from the item store to which to apply the PROC PLM statements. The general syntax of the WHERE statement is WHERE operand <operator> <operand> ; where o operand is something to be operated on. The operand can be the name of a BY variable in the item store, a SAS function, a constant, or a predefined name to identify columns in result tables. o operator is a symbol that requests a comparison, logical operation, or arithmetic calculation. All SAS expression operators are valid for a WHERE expression.","help":"WHERE expression "}],"supportSiteInformation":{"docsetId":"statug","docsetVersion":"latest","docsetTargetFile":"statug_plm_toc.htm"}}
