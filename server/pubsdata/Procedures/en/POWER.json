The POWER procedure performs prospective power and sample size analyses for a variety of goals, such as the following: o determining the sample size required to get a significant result with adequate probability (power) o characterizing the power of a study to detect a meaningful effect o conducting what-if analyses to assess sensitivity of the power or required sample size to other factors † Here prospective indicates that the analysis pertains to planning for a future study. This is in contrast to retrospective power analysis for a past study, which is not supported by the procedure. † A variety of statistical analyses are covered: o tests, equivalence tests, and confidence intervals for means o tests, equivalence tests, and confidence intervals for binomial proportions o multiple regression o tests of correlation and partial correlation o one-way analysis of variance o rank tests for comparing two survival curves o logistic regression with binary response o Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (rank-sum) test","help":"PROC POWER <PLOTONLY>;     \n\tCOXREG <ALPHA=number-list> <EVENTPROB=number-list> <EVENTSTOTAL=number-list | EVENTTOTAL=number-list | EETOTAL=number-list> ...; \n   \n\tLOGISTIC <ALPHA=number-list> <CORR=number-list> <COVARIATES=grouped-name-list> ...; \n   \n\tMULTREG <ALPHA=number-list> <MODEL=<FIXED|CONDITIONAL | RANDOM|UNCONDITIONAL>> <NFRACTIONAL> ...; \n   \n\tONECORR <ALPHA=number-list> <CORR=number-list> <DIST=<FISHERZ | T>> ...; \n   \n\tONESAMPLEFREQ <ALPHA=number-list> <CI=<AGRESTICOULL|AC | JEFFREYS | EXACT|CLOPPERPEARSON|CP>... > <EQUIVBOUNDS=grouped-number-list> ...; \n   \n\tONESAMPLEMEANS <ALPHA=number-list> <CI> <CI=<T>> ...; \n   \n\tONEWAYANOVA <ALPHA=number-list> <CONTRAST= ( values ) < ( ...values ) >> <GROUPMEANS=grouped-number-list> ...; \n   \n\tPAIREDFREQ <ALPHA=number-list> <CORR=number-list> <DISCPROPORTIONS=grouped-number-list> ...; \n   \n\tPAIREDMEANS <ALPHA=number-list> <CI | CI=DIFF> <CORR=number-list> ...; \n   \n\tPLOT INTERPOL=JOIN|NONE  KEY=BYCURVE|BYFEATURE|ONCURVES  MARKERS=ANALYSIS|COMPUTED|NICE...  ...;     \n\tTWOSAMPLEFREQ <ALPHA=number-list> <GROUPNS=grouped-number-list> <GROUPNS=grouped-number-list> ...; \n   \n\tTWOSAMPLEMEANS <ALPHA=number-list> <CI | CI=DIFF> <CV=number-list> ...; \n   \n\tTWOSAMPLESURVIVAL <ACCRUALRATEPERGROUP=number-list> <ACCRUALRATETOTAL=number-list> <ACCRUALTIME=<<number-list> | MAX>> ...; \n   \n\tTWOSAMPLEWILCOXON <ALPHA=number-list> <GROUPNS=grouped-number-list> <GROUPWEIGHTS=grouped-number-list> ...; ","arguments":[{"name":"PLOTONLY","optional":true,"description":"Specifies that only graphical results from the PLOT statement be produced.","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"COXREG","description":"The COXREG statement performs power and sample size analyses for the score test of a single scalar predictor in Cox proportional hazards regression for survival data, possibly in the presence of one or more covariates that might be correlated with the tested predictor.","help":"COXREG &lt;ALPHA=number-list&gt; &lt;EVENTPROB=number-list&gt; &lt;EVENTSTOTAL=number-list | EVENTTOTAL=number-list | EETOTAL=number-list&gt; ...","arguments":[{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the level of significance of the statistical test.
