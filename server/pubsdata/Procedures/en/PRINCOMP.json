{"name":"PRINCOMP","statements":[{"name":"PROC PRINCOMP","description":"The PRINCOMP procedure performs principal component analysis. As input you can use raw data, a correlation matrix, a covariance matrix, or a sum-of-squares-and-crossproducts (SSCP) matrix. You can create output data sets containing eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and standardized or unstandardized principal component scores. † Principal component analysis is a multivariate technique for examining relationships among several quantitative variables. The choice between using factor analysis and using principal component analysis depends in part on your research objectives. You should use the PRINCOMP procedure if you are interested in summarizing data and detecting linear relationships. You can use principal components to reduce the number of variables in regression, clustering, and so on.","help":"PROC PRINCOMP <COVARIANCE> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <N=number> <NOINT> <NOPRINT> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <PARPREFIX=name> <PLOTS=ALL | EIGEN|EIGENVALUE|SCREE | MATRIX... > <PREFIX=name> <SINGULAR=p> <STANDARD> <VARDEF=DF | N | WEIGHT|WGT... >;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tFREQ variable ;     \n\tID variables ;     \n\tPARTIAL variables ; \n   \n\tVAR variables ;     \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"COVARIANCE","optional":true,"aliases":["COV"],"description":"Computes the principal components from the covariance matrix.
