{"name":"PROBIT","statements":[{"name":"PROC PROBIT","description":"The PROBIT procedure calculates maximum likelihood estimates of regression parameters and the natural (or threshold) response rate for quantal response data from biological assays or other discrete event data. This includes probit, logit, ordinal logistic, and extreme value (or gompit) regression models. â€  Probit analysis developed from the need to analyze qualitative (dichotomous or polytomous) dependent variables within the regression framework. Many response variables are binary by nature (yes/no), while others are measured ordinally rather than continuously (degree of severity). Collett (2003) and Agresti (2002), for example, have shown ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to be inadequate when the dependent variable is discrete.
