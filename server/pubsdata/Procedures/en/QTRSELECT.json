Quantile regression uses a linear function model to fit the quantiles of a response variable conditional on the explanatory variables.

The models that PROC QTRSELECT supports can contain main effects that consist of both continuous and classification variables and interaction effects of these variables. The models can also include constructed effects such as splines. The procedure offers a number of effect-selection methods, including stepwise methods. It also offers extensive capabilities for customizing the model selection by using a wide variety of selection and stopping criteria, including significance-level-based criteria, information criteria, and modern validation-based criteria.
