Quantile regression, which was introduced by Koenker and Bassett (1978), extends the regression model to conditional quantiles of the response variable, such as the median or the 90th percentile. Quantile regression is particularly useful when the rate of change in the conditional quantile, expressed by the regression coefficients, depends on the quantile.","help":"PROC QUANTREG <ALGORITHM=SIMPLEX | INTERIOR | SMOOTH> <ALPHA=value> <CI=NONE | RANK | SPARSITY... > <DATA=SAS-data-set> <INEST=SAS-data-set> <NAMELEN=n> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <OUTEST=SAS-data-set> <PLOTS=ALL | DDPLOT | FITPLOT... > <PP>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS variables ;     \n\tEFFECT EFFECT-NAME=COLLECTION|LAG|MULTIMEMBER|MM...  <PERIOD=variable> <WITHIN=(variables) | WITHIN=variable> ...;     \n\tESTIMATE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | SCHEFFE | SIDAK>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tID variables ;     \n\tMODEL <CORRB> <COVB> <CUTOFF=value> ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT <COLUMNWISE> LEVERAGE= OUT=SAS-data-set ...;     \n\tPERFORMANCE <CPUCOUNT=<<1-1024> | ACTUAL>> <DETAILS> <THREADS> ...; \n   \n\tTEST <LR> <QINTERACT> <WALD> ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"ALGORITHM=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies an algorthm to estimate the regression parameters.","help":"ALGORITHM=SIMPLEX | INTERIOR | SMOOTH","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"SIMPLEX","description":"Simplex algorithm","type":"standalone"},{"name":"INTERIOR","description":"[Syntax: INTERIOR<(suboptions)>] Interior point algorithm.
