The QUANTSELECT procedure performs effect selection in the framework of quantile regression. A variety of effect selection methods are available, including greedy methods and penalty methods. The QUANTSELECT procedure offers extensive capabilities for customizing the effect selection processes with a variety of candidate selecting, effect-selection stopping, and final-model choosing criteria. PROC QUANTSELECT also provides graphical summaries for the effect selection processes. † The QUANTSELECT procedure compares most closely to the GLMSELECT and QUANTREG procedures. PROC GLMSELECT performs effect selection in the framework of general linear models. PROC QUANTREG supports a variety of estimation and inference methods for quantile regression but does not directly provide effect selection facilities. The QUANTSELECT procedure, as a counterpart of PROC GLMSELECT for quantile regression, fills this gap. † The QUANTSELECT procedure focuses on linear quantile models for univariate responses and offers great flexibility for and insight into the effect selection algorithm. The QUANTSELECT procedure inherits most of its syntax from PROC GLMSELECT and PROC QUANTREG. The QUANTSELECT procedure provides results that are similar to those of PROC GLMSELECT and PROC QUANTREG. These results (displayed tables, output data sets, and macro variables) make it easy to explore the selected models in PROC QUANTREG.","help":"PROC QUANTSELECT <DATA=SAS-data-set><MAXMACRO=n><NPRINT><OUTDESIGN<(options)=><SAS-data-set>><PLOTS=ALL | ACL|ACLPLOT | COEF|COEFFICIENTS|COEFFICIENTPANEL... ><SEED=number><TESTDATA=SAS-data-set><VALDATA=SAS-data-set>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING><NOTSORTED> ;\n\tCLASS <DELIMITER=’c’><DESCENDING><SHOW> ...;\n\tEFFECT <EFFECT-NAME>=COLLECTION|LAG|MULTIMEMBER|MM...  <PERIOD=variable><WITHIN=(variables) | WITHIN=variable> ...;\n\tMODEL <DETAILS=<ALL | SUMMARY>><HIERARCHY=<NONE | SINGLE | SINGLECLASS>><NOINT> ...;\n\tOUTPUT <OUT=SAS-data-set><PREDICTED=><RESIDUAL=> ...;\n\tPARTITION <FRACTION(<TEST=fraction> <VALIDATE=fraction>)><ROLEVAR= | ROLE=variable(<TEST=value> <TRAIN=value> <VALIDATE=value>)> ;\n\tWEIGHT variable ;","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the SAS data set to be used by PROC QUANTSELECT.

All the variables in the original data set are included in the new data set, along with variables that are created by the keyword options in the OUTPUT statement. These new variables contain the values of a variety of statistics and diagnostic measures that are calculated for each observation in the data set. The OUTPUT data set is created in row-wise form, and the variable _QUANTILE_ is optional. For each appropriate keyword specified in the OUTPUT statement, one variable for each specified quantile level is generated. These variables appear in the sorted order of the specified quantile levels. If you specify a BY statement, then a variable _BY_ that indexes the BY groups is included. For each observation, the value of _BY_ is the index of the BY group to which this observation belongs. This variable is useful for matching BY groups with macro variables that PROC QUANTSELECT creates.","help":"OUTPUT &lt;OUT=SAS-data-set&gt;&lt;PREDICTED=&gt;&lt;RESIDUAL=&gt; ...","arguments":[{"name":"OUT=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the new data set.

Either you can designate a variable in the input data set and a set of formatted values of that variable to determine the role of each observation, or you can specify proportions to use for random assignment of observations for each role. An alternative to using a PARTITION statement is to provide a variable named _ROLE_ in the input data set to define roles of observations in the input data. If you specify a PARTITION statement, then any _ROLE_ variable in the input data set is ignored. If you do not use a PARTITION statement and the input data do not contain a variable named _ROLE_, then all observations in the input data set are assigned to model training. You can specify either (but not both) of the following options: ROLEVAR=|ROLE=variable (<TEST=value> <TRAIN=value> <VALIDATE=value>) names the variable in the input data set whose values are used to assign roles to each observation.
