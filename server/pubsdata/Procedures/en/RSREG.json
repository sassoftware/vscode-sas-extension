By default a panel of contour plots is produced. The following surface-options can be specified: 3D displays three-dimensional surface plots instead of contour plots. AT <keyword><(variable=value-list | keyword <...variable=value-list | keyword>)> specifies fixed values for factors and covariates. Keywords available: MIN, MEAN, MIDRANGE, MAX. EXTEND=value extends the surface value-times the range of each factor in each direction, which enables you to see more of the fitted surface. FILL=PRED | SE | NONE produces a filled contour plot for either the predicted values or the standard errors. FILL=SE is the default. GRIDSIZE=n creates an nxn grid of points at which the estimated values for the surface and standard errors are computed, for n ≥ 0. By default, n=50. LINE<=PRED | SE | NONE> produces a contour line plot for either the predicted values or the standard errors. LINE=PRED is the default. NODESIGN suppresses the display of the design points on the contour surface plots and the overlaid contour-line plots. OVERLAYPAIRS produces overlaid contour line plots for all pairs of response variables in addition to the contour surface plots. ROTATE=angle rotates the 3D surface plots angle degrees, –180 < angle < 180. By default, angle = 57. TILT=angle tilts the 3D surface plots angle degrees, –180 < angle < 180. By default, angle = 20.
