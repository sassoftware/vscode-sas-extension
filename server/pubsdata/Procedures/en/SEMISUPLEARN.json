The semisupervised learning algorithm has numerous applications, including web page classification, image recognition, medical imaging, natural language processing, and action recognition. â€  You can use the SEMISUPLEARN procedure to read and write data in distributed form and to perform search in parallel by making full use of multicore computers or distributed computing environments.","help":"PROC SEMISUPLEARN <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <GAMMA=number> <LABEL=CAS-libref.data-table> <MAXITER=number> <NTHREADS=number>;     \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...;\n    \n\tDISPLAYOUT <INCLUDEALL> <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ...;\n    \n\tINPUT <LEVEL=<INTERVAL>> ;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <COPYVAR=variable | COPYVARS=(variables)> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n    \n\tTARGET <LEVEL=<NOMINAL>> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC SEMISUPLEARN to use.

This statement is similar to the ODS SELECT, ODS EXCLUDE, and ODS TRACE statements. However, the DISPLAY statement can improve performance when a large number of tables could be generated (such as in BY-group processing). The procedure processes the DISPLAY statement on a CAS server and thus sends only a subset of ODS tables to the SAS client. Because ODS statements are processed on a SAS client, all the display tables generated are first sent to the client and then the client creates a subset. If both DISPLAY and ODS statements are used together, the DISPLAY statement takes precedence over the ODS statements.","help":"DISPLAY &lt;CASESENSITIVE&gt; &lt;EXCLUDE&gt; &lt;EXCLUDEALL&gt; ...","arguments":[{"name":"CASESENSITIVE","optional":true,"followsDelimiter":"/","description":"Performs a case-sensitive comparison of table names in the table-list to display table names when tables are subsetted for display.
