Clinical trials are experiments on human subjects to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of new drugs or treatments. A simple example is a trial to test the effectiveness of a new drug in humans by comparing the outcomes in a group of patients who receive the new drug with the outcomes in a comparable group of patients who receive a placebo. † A clinical trial is conducted according to a plan called a protocol. A protocol details the objectives of the trial, the data collection process, and the analysis. The protocol specifies the null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, a test statistic, the probability α of a Type I error, the probability β of a Type II error, the sample size needed to attain a specified power of 1-β at an alternative reference, and critical values that are associated with the test statistic.","help":"PROC SEQDESIGN <ALTREF=θ1<(<LOWER=θ1l> <UPPER=θ1u>)>> <BOUNDARYSCALE=MLE | SCORE | STDZ... > <ERRSPEND> <MAXINFO=number> <PLOTS=ALL | ASN | BOUNDARY... > <PSS <( CREF= numbers )>> <STOPPROB <( CREF= numbers )>>;     \n\tDESIGN <ALPHA= <( <LOWER=>   <UPPER=> )>> <ALT=<LOWER | UPPER | TWOSIDED>> <BETA= <( <LOWER=>   <UPPER=> )>> ...; \n   \n\tSAMPLESIZE <MODEL=<INPUTNOBS | INPUTNEVENTS | ONESAMPLEMEAN>... > ; ","arguments":[{"name":"ALTREF=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the alternative reference—that is, the hypothetical reference under the alternative hypothesis at which the power is computed.
