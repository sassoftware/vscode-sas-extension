{"name":"SEQTEST","statements":[{"name":"PROC SEQTEST","description":"The purpose of the SEQTEST procedure is to perform interim analyses for clinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments on human beings to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of new drugs or treatments. A simple example is a trial to test the effectiveness of a new drug in humans by comparing the outcomes in a group of patients who receive the new drug with the outcomes in a comparable group of patients who receive a placebo. † A clinical trial is conducted according to a plan called a protocol. A protocol details the objectives of the trial, the data collection process, and the analyses of the data. The protocol contains information such as a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, a test statistic, the probability α of a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis), the probability β of a Type II error (incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis), the sample size needed to attain a specified power (probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis) of 1-β at an alternative reference, and critical values that are associated with the test statistic for hypothesis testing.","help":"PROC SEQTEST &lt;BETABOUNDARY=BINDING | NONBINDING&gt; &lt;BETAOVERLAP=ADJUST | NOADJUST&gt; &lt;BOUNDARY=SAS-data-set&gt; &lt;BOUNDARYADJ(ALPHA)=NONE | ERRLINE | ERRFUNCGAMMA... &gt; &lt;BOUNDARYADJ(BETA)=NONE | ERRLINE | ERRFUNCGAMMA... &gt; &lt;BOUNDARYADJ(LOWERALPHA)=NONE | ERRLINE | ERRFUNCGAMMA... &gt; &lt;BOUNDARYADJ(LOWERBETA)=NONE | ERRLINE | ERRFUNCGAMMA... &gt; &lt;BOUNDARYADJ(UPPERALPHA)=NONE | ERRLINE | ERRFUNCGAMMA... &gt; &lt;BOUNDARYADJ(UPPERBETA)=NONE | ERRLINE | ERRFUNCGAMMA... &gt; &lt;BOUNDARYADJ=NONE | ERRLINE | ERRFUNCGAMMA... &gt; &lt;BOUNDARYKEY=ALPHA | BETA | BOTH&gt; &lt;BOUNDARYSCALE=MLE | SCORE | STDZ... &gt; &lt;CIALPHA=&lt;(&lt;LOWER=al&gt; &lt;UPPER=au&gt;)&gt;&gt; &lt;CITYPELOWER | UPPER | TWOSIDED&gt; &lt;CONDPOWER &lt;( CREF=numbers )&gt;&gt; &lt;DATA &lt;(TESTVAR=variable)&gt;=SAS-data-set&gt; &lt;ERRSPEND&gt; &lt;ERRSPENDMIN(ALPHA)=&gt; &lt;ERRSPENDMIN(BETA)=&gt; &lt;ERRSPENDMIN(LOWERALPHA)=&gt; &lt;ERRSPENDMIN(LOWERBETA)=&gt; &lt;ERRSPENDMIN(UPPERALPHA)=&gt; &lt;ERRSPENDMIN(UPPERBETA)=&gt; &lt;ERRSPENDMIN&lt;(boundary)&gt;=numbers&gt; &lt;MAXINFO=number&gt; &lt;NSTAGES=number&gt; &lt;ORDER=LR | MLE | STAGEWISE&gt; &lt;PARMS &lt;(TESTVAR=variable)&gt; =SAS-data-set&gt; &lt;PLOTS=ALL | ASN | CONDPOWER... &gt; &lt;PREDPOWER&gt; &lt;PSS &lt;( CREF=numbers ) &gt;&gt; &lt;RCI&gt; &lt;STOPPROB &lt;( CREF=numbers ) &gt;&gt;; ","arguments":[{"name":"BETABOUNDARY=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies whether the β boundary is used in the computation of the Type I error level α.","help":"BETABOUNDARY=BINDING | NONBINDING","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"BINDING","description":"Computes the Type I error probability with the β (acceptance) boundary.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"NONBINDING","description":"Computes the Type I error probability without the β boundary.","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"BETAOVERLAP=","optional":true,"aliases":["OVERLAP="],"description":"Syntax: BETAOVERLAP=ADJUST | NOADJUST OVERLAP=ADJUST | NOADJUST","help":"BETAOVERLAP=ADJUST | NOADJUST","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"ADJUST","description":"The type of overlapping might result from a small β spending at an interim stage.
