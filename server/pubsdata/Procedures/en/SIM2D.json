{"name":"SIM2D","statements":[{"name":"PROC SIM2D","description":"The SIM2D procedure uses an LU decomposition technique to produce a spatial simulation for a Gaussian random field with a specified mean and covariance structure in two dimensions. † The simulation can be conditional or unconditional. If it is conditional, a set of coordinates and associated field values are read from a SAS data set. The resulting simulation honors these data values. † You can specify the mean structure as a quadratic function in the coordinates. Specify the semivariance by naming the form and supplying the associated parameters, or by using the contents of an item store file that was previously created by PROC VARIOGRAM. † PROC SIM2D can handle anisotropic and nested semivariogram models. Seven covariance models are supported: Gaussian, exponential, spherical, cubic, pentaspherical, sine hole effect, and Matérn. A single nugget effect is also supported.","help":"PROC SIM2D <DATA=SAS-data-set> <NARROW> <NOPRINT> <OUTSIM=SAS-data-set> <PLOTS=ALL | EQUATE | NONE... >;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCOORDINATES <XCOORD=(variable-name)> <YCOORD=(variable-name)> ; \n   \n\tGRID <GRIDDATA=SAS-data-set> <XCOORD=(variable-name)> <YCOORD=(variable-name)> ...; \n   \n\tID variable ;     \n\tMEAN <CONST=var1> <CX=var2> <QDATA= SAS-data-set> ...;     \n\tRESTORE IN=store-name <INFO <( info-options )>> ; \n   \n\tSIMULATE <ANGLE=angle | ANGLE=(angle-1,...,angle-k)> <NUMREAL=number> <VAR=(variable-name)> ...; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies a SAS data set containing the x and y coordinate variables and the VAR= variables in the SIMULATE statement.","help":"DATA=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"NARROW","optional":true,"description":"Restricts the variables included in the OUTSIM= data set.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"NOPRINT","optional":true,"description":"Suppresses the normal display of results.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"OUTSIM=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies a SAS data set in which to store the simulation values, iteration number, simulate statement label, variable name, and grid location.","help":"OUTSIM=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"PLOTS=","optional":true,"description":"Syntax: PLOTS <(global-plot-option)> <= plot-request <(options)>> PLOTS <(global-plot-option)> <= (plot-request <(options)> <... plot-request <(options)>>)> Controls the plots produced through ODS Graphics.
