{"name":"SIMNORMAL","statements":[{"name":"PROC SIMNORMAL","description":"The SIMNORMAL procedure can perform conditional and unconditional simulation for a set of correlated normal or Gaussian random variables. † The means, variances, and covariances (or correlations) are read from an input TYPE=CORR or TYPE=COV data set. This data set is typically produced by the CORR procedure. Conditional simulations are performed by appending a special observation, identified by the value of ’COND’ for the _TYPE_ variable, which contains the conditioning value. † The output data set from PROC SIMNORMAL contains simulated values for each of the analysis variables. Optionally, the output data set also contains the seed stream and the values of the conditioning variables. PROC SIMNORMAL produces no printed output.","help":"PROC SIMNORMAL <DATA=SAS-data-set> <NUMREAL=n> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <OUTCOND> <OUTSEED> <SEED=seed-value> <SEEDBY> <SINGULAR1=number> <SINGULAR2=number>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tCONDITION | COND variables ;\n    \n\tVAR variable ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the input data set that must be a specially structured TYPE=CORR, COV, UCORR, UCOV, or SSCP SAS data set.","help":"DATA=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"NUMREAL=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the number of realizations to generate.
