{"name":"SPECTRA","statements":[{"name":"PROC SPECTRA","description":"The SPECTRA procedure performs spectral and cross-spectral analysis of time series. You can use spectral analysis techniques to look for periodicities or cyclical patterns in data. † The SPECTRA procedure produces estimates of the spectral and cross-spectral densities of a multivariate time series. Estimates of the spectral and cross-spectral densities of a multivariate time series are produced using a finite Fourier transform to obtain periodograms and cross-periodograms. The periodogram ordinates are smoothed by a moving average to produce estimated spectral and cross-spectral densities. PROC SPECTRA can also test whether or not the data are white noise.","help":"PROC SPECTRA <A> <ADJMEAN> <ALTW> <COEF> <CROSS> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <K> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <P> <PH> <S> <WHITETEST>;     \n\tBY variables ;\n    \n\tVAR variables ;\n    \n\tWEIGHTS weight-constants | kernel-specification ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"A","optional":true,"description":"Outputs the amplitude variables (A_nn _mm) of the cross-spectrum.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"ADJMEAN","optional":true,"aliases":["CENTER"],"description":"Subtracts the series mean before performing the Fourier decomposition.
