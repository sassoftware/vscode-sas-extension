{"name":"SSM","statements":[{"name":"PROC SSM","description":"State space models (SSMs) are used for analyzing continuous response variables that are recorded sequentially according to a numeric indexing variable. In many cases, the indexing variable is time and the observations are collected at regular time intervals—for example, hourly, weekly, or monthly. In such cases, the resulting data are called time series data. In other cases, the indexing variable might not be time or the observations might not be equally spaced according to the indexing variable. These more general types of sequential data are called longitudinal data. Because of their sequential nature, these types of data exhibit some characteristic features. For example, chronologically closer measurements tend to be highly correlated while measurements farther apart are essentially uncorrelated. Data can be trending in a particular direction and can have seasonal or other periodic patterns. SSMs are specially designed to model such sequential data. They apply to both univariate and multivariate response situations and can easily incorporate predictor (independent variable) information when it is available. † The SSM procedure performs state space modeling of univariate and multivariate time series and longitudinal data.","help":"PROC SSM <BREAKPEAKS> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <NOPRINT> <OPTIMIZER( <TECHNIQUE=technique> <MAXITER=integer>)> <PLOTS=ALL | AO | MAXSHOCK... > <PRINTALL> <STATEINFO> <ZSPARSE>;     \n\tABORT <ABEND> <CANCEL> <CANCEL FILE> ...;     \n\tARRAY specification <...> ;     \n\tBY variables; \n   \n\tCALL routine(parameter-1<, ...parameter-n>); \n   \n\tCOMPONENT <PRINT=<FILTER | SMOOTH>> ; \n   \n\tDELETE;     \n\tDEPLAG name(response-variable) lag-term1 <lag-term2 …> ;     \n\tDO <OVER> <> <> ...; \n   \n\tELSE <DO> <IF> <THEN> ...; \n   \n\tEND;     \n\tEVAL <PRINT=<FILTER | SMOOTH>> ; \n   \n\tGOTO label;     \n\tID <INTERVAL=value> ; \n   \n\tIF <DO> <THEN> <WHEN> ...; \n   \n\tIRREGULAR <PRINT=SMOOTH> <VARIANCE=variable | number> ;     \n\tLINK statement-label; \n   \n\tMODEL <PRINT=<FILTER | SMOOTH>> ; \n   \n\t;     \n\tOUTPUT <ALPHA=number> <AO(<ALPHA=number> <MAXNUM=number> <MAXPCT=number>)> <BREAK(<ALPHA=number> <MAXNUM=number> <MAXPCT=number>)> ...; \n   \n\tPARMS <LOWER=(number1 number2 …) | LOWER=(number)> <UPPER=(number1 number2 …) | UPPER=(number)> ;     \n\tPUT <_PAGE_> ; \n   \n\tRETURN;     \n\t; \n   \n\tSTATE <A1(nd)> <CHECKBREAK<( ELEMENTWISE | OVERALL)>> <COV( D ) <= (var1 var2 …) | (number1 number2 …)>COV( G ) <= (var1 var2 …) | (number1 number2 …)>COV( I ) <= (variable) | (number)>COV( RANK=integer )> ...;  \n  \n\tSTOP ;     \n\tTREND <AR= φ1 φ2 …φp> <CHECKBREAK<( ELEMENTWISE | OVERALL)>> <CROSS=(var1, var2, …) | CROSS(MATCHPARM)=(var1, var2, …)> ...; \n   \n\tWHEN <DO> ; ","arguments":[{"name":"BREAKPEAKS","optional":true,"description":"Prints an alternate form of the break summary tables when the CHECKBREAK option is used in the STATE or TREND statement or when the MAXSHOCK option is used in the OUTPUT statement.

In addition, you can explicitly specify the entries of the T-block by specifying a list of numbers in parentheses, or by specifying in parentheses a list of variables that are defined by using the programming statements. The unspecified elements of the T-block are included in the list of parameters to be estimated from the data. If the elements of the T-block are supplied by a list in parentheses, the number of elements in the list depends on its structure.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"TYPE=","optional":true,"description":"Syntax: TYPE=WN TYPE=RW TYPE=LL <(SLOPECOV(I | D | G) <= (var1, var2, …) | (number1, number2, …)> )> TYPE=LL (SLOPECOV( RANK=integer) ) TYPE=SEASON (LENGTH=integer <DROPH=number-list> <KEEPH=number-list> ) TYPE=CYCLE <( <CT> <RHO=variable | number> <PERIOD=variable | number> )> TYPE=VARMA ( <p <(I | D)> =integer> <q<(D)>=integer> )","help":"TYPE=RW | LL | SEASON | CYCLE | VARMA*WN*","type":"value","arguments":[{"name":"RW","description":"dim-variate random walk","type":"standalone"},{"name":"LL","description":"Syntax: TYPE=LL <(SLOPECOV(I | D | G) <= (var1, var2, …) | (number1, number2, …)> )> Syntax: LL (SLOPECOV( RANK=integer) ) dim-variate local linear","type":"standalone"},{"name":"SEASON","description":"Syntax: SEASON (LENGTH=integer <DROPH=number-list> <KEEPH=number-list> ) dim-variate season","type":"standalone"},{"name":"CYCLE","description":"Syntax: CYCLE <( <CT> <RHO=variable | number> <PERIOD=variable | number> )> dim-variate cycle","type":"standalone"},{"name":"VARMA","description":"Syntax: VARMA ( <p <(I | D)> =integer> <q<(D)> =integer> ) dim-variate VARMA","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"W","optional":true,"description":"Syntax: W(D)= (var1 var2 …) | (number1 number2 …) W(G)= (var1 var2 …) | (number1 number2 …) W(I) <= (variable) | (number) >","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"STOP","description":"The STOP statement halts the execution of all statements that contain it, including DO statements and other control or looping statements.

The options in the TREND statement enable you to specify a wide variety of commonly used stochastic patterns. Each TREND statement in effect stands for a special pair of STATE and COMPONENT statements. You can specify more than one TREND statement. Each separate TREND statement defines a component that is assumed to be independent of all other component specifications in the model. Very often the TREND statement is used to specify a component that captures the time-varying level of the data. However, in many cases it is also used to define components of a more general nature; for example, it can be used to define a noise component that follows a stationary ARMA model.","help":"TREND &lt;AR= φ1 φ2 …φp&gt; &lt;CHECKBREAK&lt;( ELEMENTWISE | OVERALL)&gt;&gt; &lt;CROSS=(var1, var2, …) | CROSS(MATCHPARM)=(var1, var2, …)&gt; ...","arguments":[{"name":"AR=","optional":true,"description":"Lists the values of the coefficients of the nonseasonal autoregressive polynomial.","type":"value"},{"name":"CHECKBREAK=","optional":true,"description":"Turns on the checking of breaks for this trend component.
