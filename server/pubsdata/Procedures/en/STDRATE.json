{"name":"STDRATE","statements":[{"name":"PROC STDRATE","description":"[New procedure in SAS/STAT 12.1] † The STDRATE procedure computes directly standardized rates and risks for study populations. For two study populations with the same reference population, PROC STDRATE compares directly standardized rates or risks from these two populations. For homogeneous effects across strata, PROC STDRATE computes Mantel-Haenszel estimates. The STDRATE procedure also computes indirectly standardized rates and risks, including SMR. † The attributable fraction measures the excess event rate or risk fraction in the exposed population that can be attributed to the exposure. The rate or risk ratio statistic is required in the attributable fraction computation, and the STDRATE procedure estimates the ratio by using either SMR or the rate ratio statistic in the Mantel-Haenszel estimates. † Although the STDRATE procedure provides useful summary standardized statistics, standardization is not a substitute for individual comparisons of stratum-specific estimates. PROC STDRATE provides summary statistics, such as rate and risk estimates and their confidence limits, in each stratum. In addition, PROC STDRATE also displays these stratum-specific statistics by using ODS Graphics. † Note that the term standardization has different meanings in other statistical applications. For example, the STDIZE procedure standardizes numeric variables in a SAS data set by subtracting a location measure and dividing by a scale measure.","help":"PROC STDRATE <ALPHA=α> <CL=GAMMA | LOGNORMAL | NONE... > <DATA=SAS-data-set> <EFFECT=DIFF | RATIO> <METHOD=DIRECT | INDIRECT | MH> <PLOTS=ALL | DIST|DISTRIBUTION | EFFECT... > <REFDATA=SAS-data-set> <SIDES=2 | L | U> <STAT=RATE | RISK>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tPOPULATION <EVENT=variable> <GROUP <( ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | INTERNAL )> =variable> <POPEVENT=number> ...;\n    \n\tREFERENCE <EVENT=variable> <RATE <( MULT=c )> = variable> <RISK=variable> ...;\n    \n\tSTRATA <EFFECT> <MISSING> <ORDER=<DATA | FORMATTED | INTERNAL>> ...;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Requests that confidence limits be constructed with confidence level 100(1-α)%, where 0 < α < 1.
