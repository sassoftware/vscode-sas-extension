{"name":"SURVEYIMPUTE","statements":[{"name":"PROC SURVEYIMPUTE","description":"The SURVEYIMPUTE procedure imputes missing values of an item in a data set by replacing them with observed values from the same item. The principles by which the imputation is performed are particularly useful for survey data. PROC SURVEYIMPUTE also computes replicate weights (such as jackknife weights) that account for the imputation and that can be used for replication-based variance estimation for complex surveys. The procedure implements a fractional hot-deck imputation technique (Kim and Fuller 2004; Fuller 2009; Kim and Shao 2014) in addition to some traditional hot-deck imputation techniques (Andridge and Little 2010). † Nonresponse is a common problem in almost all surveys of human populations. Estimators that are based on survey data that include nonresponse can suffer from nonresponse bias if the nonrespondents are different from the respondents. Estimators that use complete cases (only the observed units) might also be less precise. Imputation techniques are important tools for reducing nonresponse bias and producing efficient estimators. † The main objectives of any imputation technique are to eliminate the nonresponse bias and to provide an imputed data set that results in consistent analyses conducted with the imputed data. In addition, a variance estimator must be available that accounts for both the sampling variance and the imputation variance. Imputation techniques use implicit or explicit models. Some model-based imputation techniques include multiple imputation, mean imputation, and regression imputation.","help":"PROC SURVEYIMPUTE <DATA=SAS-data-set> <METHOD=FEFI | HOTDECK|HD> <NDONORS=r> <NOPRINT> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <SEED=number> <VARMETHOD=BRR | JACKKNIFE|JK | NONE>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tCELLS variables ;\n    \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <ORDER=<DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ>... > <TRUNCATE <=n>> ...;\n    \n\tCLUSTER variables;\n    \n\tID variable;\n    \n\tIMPJOINT <variables>;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <DONORID<=name>> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <OUTJKCOEFS=SAS-data-set> ...;\n    \n\tREPWEIGHTS variables;\n    \n\tSTRATA variables;\n    \n\tVAR variables;\n    \n\tWEIGHT variable;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the SAS data set that contains the data to be analyzed.
