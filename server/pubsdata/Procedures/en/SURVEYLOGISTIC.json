The first form, referred to as single-trial syntax, is applicable to binary, ordinal, and nominal response data. The second form, referred to as events/trials syntax, is restricted to the case of binary response data. The single-trial syntax is used when each observation in the DATA= data set contains information about only a single trial, such as a single subject in an experiment. When each observation contains information about multiple binary-response trials, such as the counts of the number of subjects observed and the number responding, then events/trials syntax can be used. In the events/trials syntax, you specify two variables that contain count data for a binomial experiment. These two variables are separated by a slash. The value of the first variable, events, is the number of positive responses (or events), and it must be nonnegative. The value of the second variable, trials, is the number of trials, and it must not be less than the value of events.
