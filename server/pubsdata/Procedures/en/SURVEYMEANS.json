You can estimate statistics such as means, totals, proportions, quantiles, and ratios. PROC SURVEYMEANS also provides domain analysis, which computes estimates for subpopulations or domains. The procedure also estimates variances and confidence limits and performs t tests for these statistics. PROC SURVEYMEANS uses either the Taylor series (linearization) method or replication (subsampling) methods to estimate sampling errors of estimators based on complex sample designs. The sample design can be a complex survey sample design with stratification, clustering, and unequal weighting.","help":"PROC SURVEYMEANS <ALL> <ALLGEO> <ALPHA=α> <CLM> <CLSUM> <CV> <CVSUM> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DECILES> <DF> <GEOMEAN> <GMSTDERR> <LCLM> <LCLSUM> <MAX> <MEAN> <MEDIAN> <MIN> <MISSING> <NCLUSTER> <NMISS> <NOBS> <NOMCAR> <NONSYMCL> <NOSPARSE> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <PERCENTILE=(values)> <Q1> <Q3> <QUANTILE=(values)> <QUARTILES> <RANGE> <RATE=value | SAS-data-set> <STACKING> <STD> <STDERR> <SUM> <SUMWGT> <T> <TOTAL=value | SAS-data-set> <UCLM> <UCLSUM> <VAR> <VARMETHOD=BRR | JACKKNIFE | TAYLOR> <VARSUM>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tCLASS variables ;\n    \n\tCLUSTER variables ;\n    \n\tDOMAIN variables <variable*variable variable*variable*variable ... > ;\n    \n\tPOSTSTRATA <PSPCT=SAS-data-set | values> <PSTOTAL=SAS-data-set | values> ;\n    \n\tRATIO <’label’> variables / variables ;\n    \n\tREPWEIGHTS <DF=df> <JKCOEFS=jackknife-coefficient-specification> ;\n    \n\tSTRATA <LIST> ;\n    \n\tVAR variables ;\n    \n\tWEIGHT variable;\n","arguments":[{"name":"ALL","optional":true,"description":"All available statistics except those associated with geometric means","type":"standalone"},{"name":"ALLGEO","optional":true,"description":"All available statistics associated with geometric means","type":"standalone"},{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Sets the confidence level for confidence limits.
