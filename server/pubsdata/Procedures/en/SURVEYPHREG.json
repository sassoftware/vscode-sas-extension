{"name":"SURVEYPHREG","statements":[{"name":"PROC SURVEYPHREG","description":"The SURVEYPHREG procedure performs regression analysis based on the Cox proportional hazards model for sample survey data. Cox’s semiparametric model is widely used in the analysis of survival data to estimate hazard rates when adequate explanatory variables are available. The procedure provides design-based variance estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests concerning the parameters and model effects. † For statistical inference, PROC SURVEYPHREG incorporates complex survey sample designs, including designs with stratification, clustering, and unequal weighting. † The procedure also allows time-dependent explanatory variables. An explanatory variable is time-dependent if its value for any given individual can change over time. Time-dependent variables have many useful applications in survival analysis. You can include time-dependent variables such as blood pressure or blood chemistry measures that vary with time during the course of a study. You can also use time-dependent variables to test the validity of the proportional hazards model. † Several optimization techniques are available in SURVEYPHREG to maximize the log likelihood. Hazard ratio estimates can also be obtained along with parameter estimates. Sampling errors of the regression parameters and hazard ratios are computed by using either the Taylor series (linearization) method or one of the replication (resampling) methods that are based on complex sample designs (Binder; 1983; Wolter; 2007; Särndal, Swensson, and Wretman; 1992; Binder; 1992; Lohr; 2009; Fuller; 2009). These variance estimators essentially assume the finite population as fixed and estimate the variability due to the random sample selection mechanism.","help":"PROC SURVEYPHREG <DATA=SAS-data-set> <MISSING> <NOMCAR> <NOPRINT> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <RATE=value | SAS-data-set> <TOTAL=value | SAS-data-set> <VARMETHOD=BRR | JACKKNIFE | TAYLOR>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS <CPREFIX=n> <DESCENDING> <LPREFIX=n> ...; \n   \n\tCLUSTER variables ;     \n\tDOMAIN variables <variable*variable variable*variable*variable ... > ;     \n\tESTIMATE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | SCHEFFE | SIDAK>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tFREQ variable;     \n\tLSMEANS <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | DUNNETT | NELSON>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tLSMESTIMATE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | SCHEFFE | SIDAK>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tMODEL <ALPHA=α> <CLPARM<=keyword>> <COVB> ...; \n   \n\tNLOPTIONS <ABSCONV= | ABSTOL=r> <ABSFCONV=r <n> | ABSFTOL=r<n>> <ABSGCONV= | ABSGTOL=r <n>> ...;     \n\tOUTPUT ATRISK= OUT=SAS-data-set RESDEV= ...;     \n\tREPWEIGHTS <DF=df> <JKCOEFS=jackknife-coefficient-specification> ; \n   \n\tSLICE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | DUNNETT | NELSON>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tSTORE <LABEL='label'> ; \n   \n\tSTRATA <LIST> ; \n   \n\tTEST <CHISQ> <DDF=value-list> <E> ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the SAS data set that contains the data to be analyzed.

The combinations of levels of STRATA variables define the strata in the sample, where strata are nonoverlapping subgroups that were sampled independently. If your sample design has stratification at multiple stages, you should identify only the first-stage strata in the STRATA statement. If you provide replicate weights for BRR or jackknife variance estimation with a REPWEIGHTS statement, you do not need to specify a STRATA statement. The STRATA variables are one or more variables in the DATA= input data set. These variables can be either character or numeric, but the procedure treats them as categorical variables. The formatted values of the STRATA variables determine the STRATA variable levels. Thus, you can use formats to group values into levels.","help":"STRATA &lt;LIST&gt; ","arguments":[{"name":"LIST","optional":true,"followsDelimiter":"/","description":"Displays a \"Stratum Information\" table, which lists all strata together with the corresponding values of the STRATA variables.
