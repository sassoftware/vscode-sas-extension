{"name":"SURVEYREG","statements":[{"name":"PROC SURVEYREG","description":"The SURVEYREG procedure performs regression analysis for sample survey data. This procedure can handle complex survey sample designs, including designs with stratification, clustering, and unequal weighting. The procedure fits linear models for survey data and computes regression coefficients and their variance-covariance matrix. The procedure also provides significance tests for the model effects and for any specified estimable linear functions of the model parameters. Using the regression model, the procedure can compute predicted values for the sample survey data. † PROC SURVEYREG uses elementwise regression to compute the regression coefficient estimators by generalized least squares estimation. The procedure assumes that the regression coefficients are the same across strata and primary sampling units (PSUs). To estimate the variance-covariance matrix for the regression coefficients, PROC SURVEYREG uses either the Taylor series (linearization) method or replication (resampling) methods to estimate sampling errors of estimators, based on complex sample designs.","help":"PROC SURVEYREG <ALPHA=α> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <MISSING> <NOMCAR> <ORDER=DATA | FORMATTED | FREQ... > <RATE=value | SAS-data-set> <TOTAL=value | SAS-data-set> <TRUNCATE> <VARMETHOD=BRR | JACKKNIFE | TAYLOR>;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ; \n   \n\tCLASS variables ;     \n\tCLUSTER variables ;     \n\tDOMAIN variables <variable*variable variable*variable*variable ... > ;     \n\tEFFECT EFFECT-NAME=COLLECTION|LAG|MULTIMEMBER|MM...  <PERIOD=variable> <WITHIN=(variables) | WITHIN=variable> ...;     \n\tESTIMATE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | SCHEFFE | SIDAK>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tLSMEANS <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | DUNNETT | NELSON>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tLSMESTIMATE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | SCHEFFE | SIDAK>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tMODEL <ADJRSQ> <ANOVA> <CLPARM> ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT LCLM PREDICTED RESIDUAL ...; \n   \n\tREPWEIGHTS <DF=df> <JKCOEFS=jackknife-coefficient-specification> ; \n   \n\tSLICE <ADJDFE=<SOURCE | ROW>> <ADJUST=<BON | DUNNETT | NELSON>... > <ALPHA=number> ...; \n   \n\tSTORE <LABEL='label'> ; \n   \n\tSTRATA <LIST> <NOCOLLAPSE> ; \n   \n\tTEST <CHISQ> <DDF=value-list> <E> ...; \n   \n\tWEIGHT variable; ","arguments":[{"name":"ALPHA=","optional":true,"description":"Sets the confidence level for confidence limits.
