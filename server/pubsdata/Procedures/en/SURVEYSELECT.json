{"name":"SURVEYSELECT","statements":[{"name":"PROC SURVEYSELECT","description":"The SURVEYSELECT procedure provides a variety of methods for selecting probability-based random samples. The procedure can select a simple random sample or can sample according to a complex multistage sample design that includes stratification, clustering, and unequal probabilities of selection. With probability sampling, each unit in the survey population has a known, positive probability of selection. This property of probability sampling avoids selection bias and enables you to use statistical theory to make valid inferences from the sample to the survey population. † PROC SURVEYSELECT provides the following equal probability sampling methods: o simple random sampling (without replacement) o unrestricted random sampling (with replacement) o systematic random sampling o sequential random sampling o Bernoulli sampling † This procedure also provides the following probability proportional to size (PPS) methods: o PPS sampling without replacement o PPS sampling with replacement o PPS systematic sampling o PPS algorithms for selecting two units per stratum o sequential PPS sampling with minimum replacement","help":"PROC SURVEYSELECT <CERTSIZE> <CERTSIZE=certain | CERTSIZE=SAS-data-set | CERTSIZE=P> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <JTPROBS> <MAXSIZE> <MAXSIZE=max | MAXSIZE=SAS-data-set> <METHOD=PPS | PPS_BREWER | PPS_MURTHY... > <MINSIZE> <MINSIZE=min | MINSIZE=SAS-data-set> <NMAX=n> <NMIN=n> <NOPRINT> <OUT=SAS-data-set> <OUTALL> <OUTHITS> <OUTSEED> <OUTSIZE> <OUTSORT=SAS-data-set> <REPS=nreps> <SAMPRATE=r | SAMPRATE=(values) | SAMPRATE=SAS-data-set> <SAMPSIZE=n | SAMPSIZE=(values) | SAMPSIZE=SAS-data-set> <SEED=number | SEED=SAS-data-set> <SELECTALL> <SORT=NEST | SERP> <STATS>;     \n\tCONTROL variables ;     \n\tFREQ variable ;     \n\tID variables ; \n   \n\tSAMPLINGUNIT <PPS> <PRESORTED> ; \n   \n\tSIZE variable ;     \n\tSTRATA <ALLOC=<PROPORTIONAL | OPTIMAL | NEYMAN>... > <COST> <COST=(values) | SAS-data-set> ...; ","arguments":[{"name":"CERTSIZE","optional":true,"description":"Requests certainty selection, where the certainty size values are provided in the secondary input data set.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"CERTSIZE=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the certainty size value, or names a SAS data set that contains certainty size values for the strata; or specifies the certainty proportion p.","type":"value"},{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"","help":"DATA=*SAS-data-set*","type":"dataSet"},{"name":"JTPROBS","optional":true,"description":"Includes joint probabilities of selection in the OUT= output data set.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"MAXSIZE","optional":true,"description":"Requests adjustment of size measures according to the stratum maximum size values provided in the secondary input data set.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"MAXSIZE=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the maximum size value, or names a SAS data set that contains the maximum size values for the strata.","type":"value"},{"name":"METHOD=","optional":true,"aliases":["M="],"description":"Specifies the method for sample selection.","help":"METHOD=PPS | PPS_BREWER | PPS_MURTHY | PPS_SAMPFORD | PPS_SEQ | PPS_SYS | PPS_WR | SEQ | SRS | SYS | URS","type":"choice","arguments":[{"name":"PPS","description":"Requests selection with probability proportional to size and without replacement.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"PPS_BREWER","description":"Requests selection according to Brewer’s method.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"PPS_MURTHY","description":"Requests selection according to Murthy’s method.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"PPS_SAMPFORD","description":"Requests selection according to Sampford’s method.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"PPS_SEQ","description":"Requests sequential selection with probability proportional to size and with minimum replacement.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"PPS_SYS","description":"Requests systematic selection with probability proportional to size.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"PPS_WR","description":"Requests selection with probability proportional to size and with replacement.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"SEQ","description":"Requests sequential selection according to Chromy’s method.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"SRS","description":"Requests simple random sampling, which is selection with equal probability and without replacement.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"SYS","description":"Requests systematic random sampling.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"URS","description":"Requests unrestricted random sampling, which is selection with equal probability and with replacement.","type":"standalone"}]},{"name":"MINSIZE","optional":true,"description":"Requests adjustment of size measures according to the stratum minimum size values provided in the secondary input data set.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"MINSIZE=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the minimum size value, or names a SAS data set that contains the minimum size values for the strata.","type":"value"},{"name":"NMAX=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the maximum stratum sample size n for the SAMPRATE= option.","help":"NMAX=*n*","type":"value"},{"name":"NMIN=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the minimum stratum sample size n for the SAMPRATE= option.
