{"name":"SVDD","statements":[{"name":"PROC SVDD","description":"The SVDD procedure implements the support vector data description (SVDD) algorithm (Tax and Duin 2004). SVDD is a one-class classification technique that is useful in applications where data that belong to one class are abundant but data about any other class are scarce or missing. Fraud detection, equipment health monitoring, and process control are some examples of application areas where the majority of the data belong to one class. You can use SVDD to model such one-class data and subsequently use the model to perform outlier detection.","help":"PROC SVDD <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <NBINS=number> <NOPRINT> <NTHREADS=number-of-threads> <OUTLIER_FRACTION=number | FRACTION=number FRAC=number> <OUTSV=CAS-libref.data-table | SV=CAS-libref.data-table> <SCORE> <STANDARDIZE> <USECONSTANTCOLUMN>;     \n\tCODE <FILE=filename> ;\n    \n\tID variables;\n    \n\tINPUT <LEVEL=<INTERVAL | NOMINAL>> ;\n    \n\tKERNEL <BW=s> RBF ;\n    \n\tSAVESTATE <RSTORE=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n    \n\tSOLVER ACTSET STOCHS <STOL=number> ...;\n    \n\tWEIGHT variable;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC SVDD to use.
