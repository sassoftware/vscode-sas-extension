The TSCSREG procedure deals with panel data sets that consist of time series observations on each of several cross-sectional units. † The TSCSREG procedure is very similar to the PANEL procedure; for full description, syntax details, models, and estimation methods, see Chapter 19, The PANEL Procedure. The TSCSREG procedure is no longer being updated, and it shares the code base with the PANEL procedure.","help":"PROC TSCSREG <CORR> <CORRB> <COVB> <CS=number> <DASILVA> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <FIXONE> <FIXTWO> <FULLER> <M=number> <NOINT> <NOMEAN> <NOPRINT> <OUTCORR> <OUTCOV> <OUTEST=SAS-data-set> <PARKS> <PHI> <RANONE> <RANTWO> <RHO> <SINGULAR=number> <TS=number> <VAR>;     \n\tBY variables ;\n    \n\tID cross-section-id-variable time-series-id-variable ;\n    \n\tMODEL <CORRB> <COVB> <FIXONE> ...;\n    \n\tTEST equation < , equation ...> < / options > ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"CORR","optional":true,"description":"Prints the matrix of estimated correlations between the parameter estimates.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"CORRB","optional":true,"description":"Prints the matrix of estimated correlations between the parameter estimates.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"COVB","optional":true,"description":"Prints the matrix of estimated covariances between the parameter estimates.","type":"standalone"},{"name":"CS=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the number of cross sections.
