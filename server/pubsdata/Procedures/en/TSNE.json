{"name":"TSNE","statements":[{"name":"PROC TSNE","description":"The TSNE procedure implements the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimension reduction method in SAS Viya. The t-SNE method is well suited for visualization of high-dimensional data, as well as for feature engineering and preprocessing for subsequent clustering and modeling. PROC TSNE computes a low-dimensional representation, also called an embedding, of high-dimensional data into two or three dimensions. Unlike other dimension reduction methods, such as principal component analysis, t-SNE is appropriate for nonlinear data and emphasizes existing groupings in the data. The method is named t-SNE because it models the pairwise distances in low dimensions according to Studentâ€™s t-distribution.","help":"PROC TSNE <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <LEARNINGRATE=number> <MAXITERS=number> <NDIMENSIONS=number> <NOPRINT> <NTHREADS=number-of-threads> <PERPLEXITY=number>;     \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...;\n    \n\tDISPLAYOUT <INCLUDEALL> <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ...;\n    \n\tINPUT variables;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <COPYVAR=variable | COPYVARS=(variables)> <OUT=CAS-libref.data-table> ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC TSNE to use.

This statement is similar to the ODS SELECT, ODS EXCLUDE, and ODS TRACE statements. However, the DISPLAY statement can improve performance when a large number of tables could be generated (such as in BY-group processing). The procedure processes the DISPLAY statement on a CAS server and thus sends only a subset of ODS tables to the SAS client. Because ODS statements are processed on a SAS client, all the display tables generated are first sent to the client and then the client creates a subset. If both DISPLAY and ODS statements are used together, the DISPLAY statement takes precedence over the ODS statements.","help":"DISPLAY &lt;CASESENSITIVE&gt; &lt;EXCLUDE&gt; &lt;EXCLUDEALL&gt; ...","arguments":[{"name":"CASESENSITIVE","optional":true,"followsDelimiter":"/","description":"Performs a case-sensitive comparison of table names in the table-list to display table names when tables are subsetted for display.
