Typically, for any particular time period, the data in a parent node are either the sum or the average of the data of its child nodes. For example, the total sales of a product by a retail company are the sum of the sales of the same product in all its stores.","help":"PROC TSRECONCILE <AGGREGATE=SUM | AVERAGE> <ALPHA=α> <CLMETHOD=SHIFT | GAUSSIAN> DATA=CAS-libref.data-table | CHILD=CAS-libref.data-table | DISDATA=CAS-libref.data-table <DISAGGREGATION=DIFFERENCE | PROPORTIONS> <LOCKZERO> OUTFOR=CAS-libref.data-table PARENT=CAS-libref.data-table | AGGDATA=CAS-libref.data-table <SIGN=MIXED | POSITIVE | NEGATIVE> <WEIGHTED>;     \n\tBY variables ;\n    \n\tCHILDROLES <ACTUAL=variable-name> <LOWER=variable-name> <PREDICT=variable-name> ...;\n    \n\tID <END=option> <START=option> ;\n    \n\tPARENTROLES <ACTUAL=variable-name> <LOWER=variable-name> <PREDICT=variable-name> ...;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","aliases":["CHILD=","DISDATA="],"description":"Specifies the input data table that contains the forecast of the time series that represent the children nodes in the hierarchy.
