Unlike most graphs, the size of the dendrogram can vary as a function of the number of objects that appear in the dendrogram. You can specify the following dendrogram-options to control the size and appearance of the dendrogram: COMPUTEHEIGHT=a b |CH=a b specifies the constants for computing the height of the dendrogram. For n points being clustered, intercept a, and slope b, the height is based in part on a + bn. For a horizontal dendrogram, the default (given in pixels) is COMPUTEHEIGHT=100 12, the default height in pixels is max(100 + 12n, 480), the default height in inches is max(1.04167 + 0.125n, 5), and the default height in centimeters is max(2.64583 + 0.3175n, 12.7). For a vertical dendrogram, the default height is 480 pixels. The default unit is pixels, and you can use the UNIT= dendrogram-option to change the unit to inches or centimeters for this option. Inches equals pixels divided by 96, and centimeters equals inches times 2.54. COMPUTEWIDTH=a b |CW=a b specifies the constants for computing the width of the dendrogram. For n points being clustered, intercept a, and slope b, the width is based in part on . For a vertical dendrogram, the default (given in pixels) is COMPUTEWIDTH=100 12, the default width in pixels is max(100 + 12n, 640), the default width in inches is max(1.04167 + 0.125n, 6.66667), and the default width in centimeters is max(2.64583 + 0.3175n, 16.933). For a horizontal dendrogram, the default width is 640 pixels. The default unit is pixels, and you can use the UNIT= dendrogram-option to change the unit to inches or centimeters for this option. Inches equals pixels divided by 96, and centimeters equals inches times 2.54. HEIGHT=PROPORTION | NCL | VAREXP or H=P | N | V specifies the method for drawing the height of the dendrogram. HEIGHT=PROPORTION is the default. HEIGHT=PROPORTION specifies that the total proportion of variance explained by the clusters at the current level of the tree is used. HEIGHT=NCL specifies that the number of clusters is used. HEIGHT=VAREXP specifies that the total variance explained by the clusters at the current level of the tree is used. HORIZONTAL | VERTICAL specifies either a horizontal dendrogram with the objects on the vertical axis (HORIZONTAL) or a vertical dendrogram with the objects on the horizontal axis (VERTICAL). The default is HORIZONTAL. SETHEIGHT=height SH=height specifies the height of the dendrogram. By default, the height is based on the COMPUTEHEIGHT= option. The default unit is pixels, and you can use the UNIT= dendrogram-option to change the unit to inches or centimeters for this dendrogram-option. SETWIDTH=width SW=width specifies the width of the dendrogram. By default, the width is based on the COMPUTEWIDTH= option. The default unit is pixels, and you can use the UNIT= dendrogram-option to change the unit to inches or centimeters for this dendrogram-option.
