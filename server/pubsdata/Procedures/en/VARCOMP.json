{"name":"VARCOMP","statements":[{"name":"PROC VARCOMP","description":"The VARCOMP procedure handles general linear models that have random effects. Random effects are classification effects with levels that are assumed to be randomly selected from an infinite population of possible levels. PROC VARCOMP estimates the contribution of each of the random effects to the variance of the dependent variable. † A single MODEL statement specifies the dependent variables and the effects: main effects, interactions, and nested effects. The effects must be composed of classification variables; no continuous variables are allowed on the right side of the equal sign.","help":"PROC VARCOMP <DATA=SAS-data-set> <EPSILON=number> <MAXITER=number> <METHOD=TYPE1 | MIVQUE0 | ML... >;     \n\tBY <DESCENDING> <NOTSORTED> ;\n    \n\tCLASS variables ;\n    \n\tMODEL <ALPHA=α> <CL=<MLS | GCL>> <FIXED=n> ...;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the input SAS data set to use.
