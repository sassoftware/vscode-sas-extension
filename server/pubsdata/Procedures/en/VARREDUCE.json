{"name":"VARREDUCE","statements":[{"name":"PROC VARREDUCE","description":"The VARREDUCE procedure is a high-performance procedure that performs both supervised and unsupervised variable selection on the SAS appliance. You can use the VARREDUCE procedure to read data in distributed form and perform variable selection in parallel in single-machine mode or distributed mode. † The VARREDUCE procedure performs unsupervised variable selection by identifying a set of variables that jointly explain the maximum amount of data variance. Unlike principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces dimensionality by generating a set of new variables (variable extraction), the VARREDUCE procedure reduces dimensionality by selecting a subset of the original variables (variable selection). Thus, this technique preserves model interpretation.","help":"PROC VARREDUCE <DATA=CAS-libref.data-table> <MATRIX=CORR | COV | SSCP> <TECHNIQUE=VARIANCEANALYSIS|VAR | DISCRIMINANTANALYSIS|DSC>;     \n\tCLASS <DESCENDING> <MISSING> ;\n    \n\tDISPLAY <CASESENSITIVE> <EXCLUDE> <EXCLUDEALL> ...;\n    \n\tDISPLAYOUT <NOREPLACE> <REPEATED> ;\n    \n\tFREQ variable ;\n    \n\tREDUCE SUPERVISED <AIC> <AICC> <BIC> ...;\n    \n\tREDUCE UNSUPERVISED <MAXEFFECTS=n> <MAXITER=n | MAXSTEPS=n> <VARIANCEEXPLAINED=fraction | VAREXP=fraction> ...;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Names the input data table for PROC VARREDUCE to use.

The procedure processes the DISPLAY statement on a CAS server and thus sends only a subset of ODS tables to the SAS client.
