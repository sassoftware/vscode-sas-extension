{"name":"X11","statements":[{"name":"PROC X11","description":"The X11 procedure, an adaptation of the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-11 Seasonal Adjustment program, seasonally adjusts monthly or quarterly time series. The procedure makes additive or multiplicative adjustments and creates an output data set containing the adjusted time series and intermediate calculations. † The X11 procedure also provides the X-11-ARIMA method developed by Statistics Canada. This method fits an ARIMA model to the original series, then uses the model forecast to extend the original series. This extended series is then seasonally adjusted by the standard X-11 seasonal adjustment method. The extension of the series improves the estimation of the seasonal factors and reduces revisions to the seasonally adjusted series as new data become available.","help":"PROC X11 <DATA= SAS-data-set> <NOPRINT> <OUTEXTRAP> <OUTSPAN= SAS-data-set> <OUTSTB= SAS-data-set> <OUTTDR= SAS-data-set> <YRAHEADOUT>;     \n\tARIMA <BACKCAST= n> <CHICR= value> <CONVERGE= value> ...;\n    \n\tBY variables ;\n    \n\tID variables ;\n    \n\tMACURVES <FEBRUARY=<'3' | '3X3' | '3X5'>... > <JANUARY=<'3' | '3X3' | '3X5'>... > <MARCH=<'3' | '3X3' | '3X5'>... > ...;\n    \n\tMONTHLY <ADDITIVE> <CHARTS=<STANDARD | FULL | NONE>> <DATE= variable> ...;\n    \n\tOUTPUT <OUT= SAS-data-set> ;\n    \n\tPDWEIGHTS <MONDAY=> <SUNDAY=> <TUESDAY=> ...;\n    \n\tQUARTERLY <ADDITIVE> <CHARTS=<STANDARD | FULL | NONE>> <DATE= variable> ...;\n    \n\tSSPAN <CUTOFF= value> <NDEC= n> <TDCUTOFF= value> ...;\n    \n\tTABLES <A1> <A2> <A3> ...;\n    \n\tVAR variables ;\n","arguments":[{"name":"DATA=","optional":true,"description":"Specifies the input SAS data set used.
