{"name":"X12","statements":[{"name":"PROC X12","description":"The X12 procedure, an adaptation of the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment program (U.S. Bureau of the Census; 2001c), seasonally adjusts monthly or quarterly time series. The procedure makes additive or multiplicative adjustments and creates an output data set that contains the adjusted time series and intermediate calculations. † The X-12-ARIMA program combines the capabilities of the X-11 program (Shiskin, Young, and Musgrave; 1967) and the X-11-ARIMA/88 program (Dagum; 1988) and also introduces some new features (Findley et al.; 1998). One of the main enhancements involves the use of a regARIMA model, a regression model with ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) errors. Thus, the X-12-ARIMA program contains methods developed by both the U.S. Census Bureau and Statistics Canada. In addition, the X-12-ARIMA automatic modeling routine is based on the TRAMO (time series regression with ARIMA noise, missing values, and outliers) method (Gomez and Maravall; 1997a, 1997b). The four major components of the X-12-ARIMA program are regARIMA modeling, model diagnostics, seasonal adjustment that uses enhanced X-11 methodology, and post-adjustment diagnostics. Statistics Canada’s X-11 method fits an ARIMA model to the original series, and then uses the model forecast to extend the original series. This extended series is then seasonally adjusted by the standard X-11 seasonal adjustment method. The extension of the series improves the estimation of the seasonal factors and reduces revisions to the seasonally adjusted series as new data become available.","help":"PROC X12 <AUXDATA=SAS-data-set><DATA=SAS-data-set><DATE=variable | DATEVAR=variable><INEVENT=SAS-data-set><INTERVAL=DAY | HOUR | MINUTE... ><MDLINFOIN=SAS-data-set><MDLINFOOUT=SAS-data-set><NOPRINT><NOTRIMMISS><OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set><PERIODOGRAM><PLOTS=ALL | NONE | SERIES... ><SEASONS=number><SPAN=(mmmyy ,mmmyy ) | SPAN=(’yyQq’ ,’yyQq’ )><SPECTRUMSERIES=table-name><START=mmmyy | START=’yyQq’ | STARTDATE=mmmyy | STARTDATE=’yyQq’>;     \n\tADJUST <PREDEFINED=<LOM | LOQ | LPYEAR>> ;\n\tARIMA <MODEL=((p d q) (P D Q)s)> ;\n\tAUTOMDL <DIFFORDER=(nonseasonal order, seasonal order)><MAXDIFF=(nonseasonal order, seasonal order)><MAXORDER=(nonseasonal order, seasonal order)> ...;\n\tBY variables ;\n\tCHECK <MAXLAG=value><PRINT=<ACF | PACF | ACFSQUARED>... > ;\n\tESTIMATE <ITPRINT><MAXITER=value><TOL=value> ...;\n\tEVENT <B=(value <F> ...)><USERTYPE=<AO | CONSTANT | EASTER>... > ;\n\tFORECAST <LEAD=value> ;\n\tID variables ;\n\tIDENTIFY <DIFF=(order, order, order)><MAXLAG=value><SDIFF=(order, order, order)> ...;\n\tINPUT <B=(value <F> ...)><USERTYPE=<AO | CONSTANT | EASTER>... > ;\n\tOUTLIER <CV=value><SPAN=(mmmyy ,mmmyy ) | SPAN=(’yyQq’ ,’yyQq’ )><TYPE=<NONE | (AO LS TC) | (AO LS)>... > ...;\n\tOUTPUT <A1><A2><OUT=SAS-data-set> ...;\n\tREGRESSION <B=(value <F> ...)> PREDEFINED=CONSTANT< / B= >|LOM|LOMSTOCK...
