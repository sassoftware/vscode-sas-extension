{"name":"X12","statements":[{"name":"PROC X12","description":"The X12 procedure, an adaptation of the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-12-ARIMA Seasonal Adjustment program (U.S. Bureau of the Census; 2001c), seasonally adjusts monthly or quarterly time series. The procedure makes additive or multiplicative adjustments and creates an output data set that contains the adjusted time series and intermediate calculations. † The X-12-ARIMA program combines the capabilities of the X-11 program (Shiskin, Young, and Musgrave; 1967) and the X-11-ARIMA/88 program (Dagum; 1988) and also introduces some new features (Findley et al.; 1998). One of the main enhancements involves the use of a regARIMA model, a regression model with ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) errors. Thus, the X-12-ARIMA program contains methods developed by both the U.S. Census Bureau and Statistics Canada. In addition, the X-12-ARIMA automatic modeling routine is based on the TRAMO (time series regression with ARIMA noise, missing values, and outliers) method (Gomez and Maravall; 1997a, 1997b). The four major components of the X-12-ARIMA program are regARIMA modeling, model diagnostics, seasonal adjustment that uses enhanced X-11 methodology, and post-adjustment diagnostics. Statistics Canada’s X-11 method fits an ARIMA model to the original series, and then uses the model forecast to extend the original series. This extended series is then seasonally adjusted by the standard X-11 seasonal adjustment method. The extension of the series improves the estimation of the seasonal factors and reduces revisions to the seasonally adjusted series as new data become available.","help":"PROC X12 <AUXDATA=SAS-data-set> <DATA=SAS-data-set> <DATE=variable | DATEVAR=variable> <INEVENT=SAS-data-set> <INTERVAL=DAY | HOUR | MINUTE... > <MDLINFOIN=SAS-data-set> <MDLINFOOUT=SAS-data-set> <NOPRINT> <NOTRIMMISS> <OUTSTAT=SAS-data-set> <PERIODOGRAM> <PLOTS=ALL | NONE | SERIES... > <SEASONS=number> <SPAN=(mmmyy ,mmmyy ) | SPAN=(’yyQq’ ,’yyQq’ )> <SPECTRUMSERIES=table-name> <START=mmmyy | START=’yyQq’ | STARTDATE=mmmyy | STARTDATE=’yyQq’>;     \n\tADJUST <PREDEFINED=<LOM | LOQ | LPYEAR>> ; \n   \n\tARIMA <MODEL=((p d q) (P D Q)s)> ; \n   \n\tAUTOMDL <DIFFORDER=(nonseasonal order, seasonal order)> <MAXDIFF=(nonseasonal order, seasonal order)> <MAXORDER=(nonseasonal order, seasonal order)> ...;     \n\tBY variables ;     \n\tCHECK <MAXLAG=value> <PRINT=<ACF | PACF | ACFSQUARED>... > ; \n   \n\tESTIMATE <ITPRINT> <MAXITER=value> <TOL=value> ...; \n   \n\tEVENT <B=(value <F> ...)> <USERTYPE=<AO | CONSTANT | EASTER>... > ; \n   \n\tFORECAST <LEAD=value> ; \n   \n\tID variables ;     \n\tIDENTIFY <DIFF=(order, order, order)> <MAXLAG=value> <SDIFF=(order, order, order)> ...;     \n\tINPUT <B=(value <F> ...)> <USERTYPE=<AO | CONSTANT | EASTER>... > ; \n   \n\tOUTLIER <CV=value> <SPAN=(mmmyy ,mmmyy ) | SPAN=(’yyQq’ ,’yyQq’ )> <TYPE=<NONE | (AO LS TC) | (AO LS)>... > ...; \n   \n\tOUTPUT <A1> <A2> <OUT=SAS-data-set> ...; \n   \n\tREGRESSION <B=(value <F> ...)> PREDEFINED=CONSTANT< / B= >|LOM|LOMSTOCK...
