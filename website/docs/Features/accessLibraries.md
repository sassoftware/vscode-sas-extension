# Accessing Libraries and Tables

After you configure the SAS extension for a SAS Viya, SAS 9.4 (local), or SAS 9.4 (remote-IOM) environment, you can access your connected libraries.

You can use the Libraries pane to delete a table, drag and drop tables into your SAS program code, or view the table data.
