:::note

Starting with Visual Studio Code version 1.93, [the language for SQL files has been renamed](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_renamed-sql-to-ms-sql) from 'SQL' to 'MS SQL'. As a result, the SQL cell in SAS Notebook is now labeled 'MS SQL'. The SAS Extension for Visual Studio Code does not control the label of the SQL cell in SAS Notebook. The functionality of the SQL cell has not changed, however. Valid PROC SQL code continues to work in the MS SQL cell.

## Export

To export your SAS Notebook to other formats, click the **More Actions** (`...`) button on the notebook toolbar at top, and select `Export`. The following formats are supported.

### SAS

PYTHON and SQL code cells will be wrapped with PROC PYTHON/SQL respectively to be executed on SAS. Markdown cells will be converted to block comments.

### HTML

The exported HTML will be in Light or Dark theme depending on your VS Code theme kind.

By default it doesn't include SAS log into the exported HTML file. To include log, check the `SAS.notebook.export.includeLog` setting.
