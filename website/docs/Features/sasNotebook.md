## Export

To export your SAS Notebook to other formats, click the **More Actions** (`...`) button on the notebook toolbar at top, and select `Export`. The following formats are supported.

### SAS

PYTHON and SQL code cells will be wrapped with PROC PYTHON/SQL respectively to be executed on SAS. Markdown cells will be converted to block comments.

By default it doesn't include SAS log into the exported HTML file. To include log, check the `SAS.notebook.export.includeLog` setting.
